00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.400
This lecture is about the syntagmatic

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.070
relation discovery and mutual

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.690
information.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.810
In this lecture, we're going to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.590
continue discussing syntagmatic

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.610
relation discovery.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.630
In particular, we're going to talk

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.920
about another concept, the information

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.590
theory, called mutual information.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.710
And how it can be used to discover

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.030
syntagmatic relations?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.680
Before we talked about a problem of

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.510
conditional entropy, and that is the

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.680
conditional entropy computed on

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.130
different pairs of words is not really

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.130
comparable, so that makes it hard to

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.520
discover strong syntagmatic relations

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.510
globally from corpus.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.440
So now we're going to introduce mutual

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.853
information, which is another concept

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:55.770
in information theory that allows us

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.662
to, in some sense, normalize the

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.470
conditional entropy to make.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.950
a more comparable across different

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.470
pairs.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.810
In particular, mutual information,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.840
denoted by I(X;Y), measures

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.950
the entropy reduction of X obtained from

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.290
knowing Y.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.450
More specifically the question we're

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.000
interested in here, is how much

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600
reduction in the entropy of X can we

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.480
obtain by knowing Y.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.995
So mathematically, it can be defined as

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:32.420
the difference between the original

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.950
entropy of X and the conditional

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.820
entropy of X given Y.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.751
And you might see here you can see

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:41.199
here.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.625
It can also be defined as a reduction

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:47.230
of entropy of Y, because of knowing

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.810
X.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.960
Normally the two conditional entropies

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.850
H(X|Y) and H(Y|X) are

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.890
not equal.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.140
 But interestingly,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.060
the reduction of entropy

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.990
by knowing one of them is actually

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.000
equal, so this quantity is called

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.580
mutual information denoted by I here

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.450
and this function has some interesting

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.970
properties.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.733
First, it's also non negative.

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:19.420
This is easy to understand becausw the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.260
original entropy is always not going to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.760
be lower than the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.185
possibly reduced conditional

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:28.707
entropy.

00:02:28.707 --> 00:02:30.940
In other words, the conditional entropy

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.400
would never exceed the original entropy.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.780
Knowing some information can always

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.666
help us potentially, but won't hurt us

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:40.350
in predicting X.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.520
The second property is that it's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.830
symmetric while conditional entropy is

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.790
not symmetrical.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.250
Mutual information is.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.440
The third property is that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.920
it reaches its minimum zero if and only

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.200
if the two random variables are

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.610
completely independent.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.610
That means knowing one of them doesn't

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.390
tell us anything about the other.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.430
And this last property can be verified

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.010
by simply looking at the equation

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.470
above.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.990
And it reaches 0 if and only if the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.360
conditional entropy of X given Y is

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.593
exactly the same as original entropy of

00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:24.139
X.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.390
So that means knowing why did not help

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.460
at all, and that's when X&amp;Y are

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.640
completely independent.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.400
Now when we fix X to rank different

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.980
Ys using conditional entropy would

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.073
give the same order as ranking based on

00:03:43.073 --> 00:03:44.990
mutual information, because in the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.046
function here H of X is fixed because X

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:49.839
is fixed.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.625
So ranking based on mutual information

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:54.041
is exactly the same as ranking based on

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.320
the conditional entropy of X given Y.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.270
But the mutual information allows us to

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.370
compare different pairs of X&amp;Y, so

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.646
that's why mutual information is more

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:08.120
general and in general more useful.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.120
So let's examine them intuition of

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.100
using mutual information for syntagmatic

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.030
relation mining.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.330
Now the question we ask for syntactic

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.370
relation mining is whenever eats

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.050
occurs, what other words also tend to

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.430
occur?

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.940
So this question can be framed as a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.670
mutual information question, that is,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.346
which was have higher mutual

00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:33.525
information with eats.

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:35.430
So we're going to compute the mutual

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.190
information between eats and other

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.710
words.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.430
And if we do that, and it's basically a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.310
based on the same intuition as in

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.432
conditional entropy, we will see that

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:47.450
words that are strongly associated with

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.580
each will tend to have high mutual

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.070
information, whereas words that are not

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.313
related.

00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:54.790
We have lower mutual information, so

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.500
this I give some example here.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.470
The mutual information between eats

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.610
and meats, which is the same as between

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.955
meats and eats cause major information

00:05:04.955 --> 00:05:08.180
is symmetric is expected to be higher

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.580
than

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.920
The mutual information between eats and

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.320
the.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.660
Because knowing the doesn't really

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.410
help us predict eats. Similarly knowing

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.140
eats doesn't help us predicting the as

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.600
well.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.730
And you also can easily see that the

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.510
mutual information between  a word and

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.385
itself is the largest which is equal to

00:05:32.385 --> 00:05:33.410
the mutual info.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.860
The entropy of this word.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.820
So because in this case the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.380
reduction is maximum

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.310
because knowing one would allow us to

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.950
predict the other completely so the

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.530
conditional entropy is zero.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.070
Therefore the mutual information

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.170
reaches its maximum.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.310
It's going to be

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.750
larger than or equal to the mutual information

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.710
between eats and another word.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.534
In other words, picking any other

00:06:04.534 --> 00:06:06.540
word, and computing mutual information

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.450
between eats and that word,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.260
you won't get any mutual information

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.040
larger than the mutual information

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.670
between eats and itself.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.450
So now let's think about how to compute

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.955
the mutual information.

00:06:20.955 --> 00:06:23.590
Now, in order to do that, we often.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.265
use a different form of mutual

00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:29.270
information, and we can mathematically

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.570
write the mutual information into the

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.850
form shown on this slide, where we

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.330
essentially see a formula that computes

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.790
what's called KL-divergences or

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.613
callback labeler divergance.

00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:45.330
This is another term in information

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.390
theory that measures the divergance

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.910
between two distributions.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.220
Now if you look at the formula, it's

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.630
also sum over many combinations of

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.340
different values of the two random

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.640
variables, but inside the sum mainly

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.950
we're doing a comparison between 2

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.210
joint distributions.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.600
The numerator has the joint actual

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.280
observed.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.390
Join the distribution of the two random

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.140
variables.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.780
The bottom part of the denominator can

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.730
be interpreted as the expected joint

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.490
distribution of the two random

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.250
variables.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.850
If there were independent.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.130
Because when two random variables are

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.690
independent, they joined distribution

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.689
is equal to the product of the two

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.900
probabilities.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.110
So this comparison would tell us

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.196
whether the two variables are indeed

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:40.933
independent if there indeed

00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:42.310
independent, then we would expect that

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.400
the two are the same.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.115
But if the numerator is different from

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:49.570
the denominator, that would mean the

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.385
two variables are not independent, and

00:07:52.385 --> 00:07:54.700
that helps measure the association.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.790
The sum is simply to take into

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.990
consideration of all the combinations

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.170
of the values of these two random

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.700
variables.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.570
In our case, each random variable can

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.480
choose one of the two values 0 or 1, so we

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.000
have four combinations here.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.900
So if we look at this form of mutual

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.640
information it shows that the mutual

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.325
information measures the diversions of

00:08:18.325 --> 00:08:20.990
the actual joint distribution from the

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.850
expected distribution under the

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.315
independence assumption.

00:08:24.315 --> 00:08:27.700
The larger this divergence is, the higher

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.550
the mutual information would be.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.990
So now let's further look at the what

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.230
are exactly the probabilities involved

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.000
in this formula of mutual information.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.689
And here I listed all the probabilities

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.270
involved and it's easy for you to

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.240
verify that basically we have first 2

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.990
probabilities corresponding to the

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.640
presence or absence of each word.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.040
So for W1, we have two probabilities

00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.800
shown here.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.340
They should sum to 1 because a word can

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.560
either be present or absent in the

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.260
segment.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.260
And similarly for the second word, we

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.700
also have two probabilities

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.090
representing presence or absence of

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.540
this word, and this sums to one

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.110
as well.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.680
And then finally we have a lot of joint

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.410
probabilities that represented the

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.780
scenarios of Co-occurrences of the two

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.260
words.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.360
And they are shown here.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.370
Right, so this sums to 1 because

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.700
the two words can only have these four

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.950
possible scenarios.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.820
Either they both occur.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.560
So in that case both variables will

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.790
have a value of one or one of them

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.460
occurs.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.690
There are two scenarios.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.050
In these two cases, one of the random

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.030
variables will be equal to 1 and the

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.372
other would be 0.

00:09:57.372 --> 00:10:01.610
And finally we have the scenario when

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.190
none of them occurs.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.150
So this is when the two variables

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.610
taking a value of 0.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.900
And they're summing up to 1, so these

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.800
are the probabilities involved in the

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.490
calculation of mutual information.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:13.790
here.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.850
Once we know how to calculate these

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.700
probabilities, we can easily calculate

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.670
the mutual information.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.110
It's also interesting to

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.430
note that there are some

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.920
relations or constraints among these

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.630
probabilities, and we already saw two

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.275
of them, so the in the previous slide

00:10:36.275 --> 00:10:37.980
that you have seen that the

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.690
marginal probabilities of these words

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.620
sum to one, and we also have seen this

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.390
constraint

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.380
that says the two words can only have

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.140
these four different scenarios of Co

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.130
occurrences, but we also have some

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.000
additional constraints listed in the

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.540
bottom.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.460
And so, for example, this one means

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.850
if we add up the probabilities that we

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.980
observe the two words occur together

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.826
and the probabilities when the word

00:11:08.826 --> 00:11:10.797
the first word occurs and the second

00:11:10.797 --> 00:11:13.068
word doesn't occur, we get exactly the

00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:15.675
probability that the first word is

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:16.109
observed.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.752
In other words, and when the word is

00:11:18.752 --> 00:11:20.820
observed when the first word is

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.450
observed and there are only two

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.160
scenarios depending on weather second

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.920
word is also observed.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.410
So this probability captures the first

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.560
scenario when the signal word actually

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.629
is also observed.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.570
And this captures the second scenario

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.010
when the seond word is not observed,

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.770
so we only see the first word.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.850
And it's easy to see the other

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.970
equations also follow the same

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.570
reasoning.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.540
Now these equations allow us to compute

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.170
some probabilities based on other

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.080
probabilities.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.730
And this can simplify the computation.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.940
So more specifically, and if we know the

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.140
probability that a word is present, and

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.115
in this case right?

00:12:04.115 --> 00:12:05.140
So if we know this.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.194
And if we know the presence of the

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:11.650
probability of presence of the second

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:15.590
word, then we can easily compute their

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.120
absence probability, right?

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.720
It's very easy to use this equation

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.270
to do that.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.519
An so we this will take care of the

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.280
computation of these probabilities of

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.800
presence or absence of each word.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.680
Now let's look at their joint

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.100
distribution, right?

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.540
Let's assume that we also have

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.770
available probability that they

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:38.770
occur together.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.140
Now it's easy to see that we can

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.985
actually compute the all the rest of

00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:45.880
these probabilities based on these.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.850
Specifically, for example, using this

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.330
equation, we can compute the

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.590
probability that the first word

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.090
occurred and the second word did not,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.585
because we know these probabilities in

00:12:58.585 --> 00:12:59.340
the boxes.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.550
And similarly, using this equation we

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.050
can compute the probability that we

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.750
observe only the second word.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.130
And then finally we.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.320
This probability can be calculated by

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.191
using this equation, because now this

00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:15.610
is known and this is also known and

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.180
this is already known right?

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.680
So this can be easier to calculate.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.540
Right, so now this can be calculated.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.890
So this slide shows that we only need

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.860
to know how to compute these three

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.809
probabilities that are shown in the

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.060
boxes, namely the presence of each word

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.930
and the Co occurrence of both words in

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:41.500
a segment.
