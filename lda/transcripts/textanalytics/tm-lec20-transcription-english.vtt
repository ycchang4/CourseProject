00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.590
This lecture is about a mixture of

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:03.990
unigram language models.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.640
In this lecture we will continue

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.866
discussing probabilistic topic models.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.780
In particular, we're going to introduce

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.140
a mixture of unigram language models.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.330
This is a slide that you have seen

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.450
earlier where we talked about how to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.440
get rid of the background words that

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.640
we have on top of estimated language

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.420
model for one document.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.740
So if you want to solve the problem.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.250
It will be useful to think about why we

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.580
end up having this problem.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.436
Well, this is obviously because these

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:49.205
words are very frequent in our data and

00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.650
we are using a maximum likelihood

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.700
estimate and then the estimator

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.250
obviously would have to assign high

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.170
probabilities for these words in order

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.750
to maximize the likelihood.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.800
So in order to get rid of them, that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.390
would mean we have to do something

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.170
different here.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.855
In particular, we have to say that this

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:09.920
distribution doesn't have to explain

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.300
all the words in the text data, or

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.470
we're going to say these common words

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.950
should not be explained by this

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.420
distribution.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.830
So one natural way to solve the problem

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.240
is to think about using another

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.830
distribution to account for just these

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.640
common words.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.230
This way the two distributions can be

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.100
mixed together to generate the text

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.840
data and will let the other model which

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.516
we called background topic model to

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:40.330
generate the common words.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.060
This way our target is the topic theta

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.499
here would be only generating the content words

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.950
that characterize the content of the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:51.560
document.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.810
So how does this work?

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.960
It's just a small modification of the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.630
previous set up where we have just one

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.290
distribution.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.125
Since we now have two distributions, we

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.687
have to decide which distribution to

00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:07.990
use when we generate the word, but

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.098
each word will still be sampled from one

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:13.330
of the two distributions, right?

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.800
So text data is still generating the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.830
same way.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.164
Namely, we're going to generate a one

00:02:19.164 --> 00:02:20.180
word at each time.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.400
An eventually we generated a lot of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.860
words.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.490
When we generate the word, however,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.376
we're going to 1st decide which of the

00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:30.760
two distributions to use, and this is

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.710
controlled by

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.542
another probability: probability of

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:37.953
theta sub D and probability of

00:02:37.953 --> 00:02:39.830
theta sub B here.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.605
So this is the probability of selecting

00:02:44.605 --> 00:02:46.735
the topic word distribution.

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.902
This is the probability of selecting

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:53.010
the background word distribution

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.690
denoted by Theta sub B.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.930
Now in this case I just give example

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.443
where we can set both to .5.

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:02.780
So if you can do basically flip a coin

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.450
a fair coin to decide which one to use.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.490
But in general these probabilities

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.720
don't have to be equal, so you might

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.920
bias towards using one topic more than

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.830
the other.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.530
So now the process of generating a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.900
word would be the first to flip a coin

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.000
based on these probabilities of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.330
choosing each model and if.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.330
Let's say the coin shows up as head,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.720
which means we're going to use the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.700
topic word distribution.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.590
Then we're going to use this word

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.470
distribution to generate a word.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.880
Otherwise we might be going through

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.800
this path.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.590
And we're going to use the background

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.690
word distribution to generate the word.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.870
So in such a case we have a model that

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.980
has some uncertainty associated with

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.410
the use of a word distribution.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.123
But we can still think of this as a

00:03:57.123 --> 00:03:59.880
model for generating text data and such

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.380
a model is called a mixture model.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.785
So now let's see.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.355
In this case, what's the probability of

00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:07.618
observing the word w?

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:11.040
Now here I showed some words like "the"

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.350
and "text", so as in all cases, once we

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.860
set up the model, we're interested in

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.520
computing the likelihood function.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.230
The basic question is, so what's the

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.910
probability of observing a specific

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.530
word here?

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.520
Now we know that the word can be

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.020
observed from each of the two

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.150
distributions, so we have to consider 2

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.750
cases.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.350
Therefore it's a sum over these two

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.770
cases.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.500
The first case is to use the topic

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.297
word distribution to generate the

00:04:39.297 --> 00:04:41.932
word, and in such a case, then the

00:04:41.932 --> 00:04:44.370
probability would be the probability of

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.802
Theta sub D, which is the probability

00:04:46.802 --> 00:04:49.924
of choosing the model multiplied by the

00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:51.865
probability of actually observing the

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:53.510
word from that model.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.870
Both events must happen in order to

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.676
observe "the".

00:04:56.676 --> 00:05:00.081
We first must have chosen the topic of

00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:04.269
Â and then we also have to actually

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.510
have sampled the word "the" from the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.030
distribution and similarly the second

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.890
part accounts for a different way of

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.430
generating the word from the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.080
background.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.368
Now obviously the probability of text

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:21.020
the same is all similar, right?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.770
So we also consider two ways of

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.330
generating text, and each case is a

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.920
product of the probability of choosing

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.460
a particular word distribution

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.170
multiplied by the probability of

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.090
observing the word from that

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.790
distribution.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.260
Now later you will see this is actually

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.980
general form, so you might want to make

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.110
sure that you have really understood

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.150
this expression here.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.110
And you should convince yourself that

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.100
this is indeed the probability of

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.050
observing text.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.155
So to summarize, what we observe here,

00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:54.800
the probability of a word from a

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.220
mixture model is in general a sum over

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.320
all different ways of generating the

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.590
word.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.990
And in each case it's a product of the

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.660
probability of selecting that component

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.180
model.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.400
multiplied by the probability of

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.580
actually observing the data point from

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.480
that component model, and this is

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.890
something quite general and you will

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.870
see this occurring often later.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.030
So the basic idea of a mixture model is

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.790
just to treated these two distributions

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.586
together as one model.

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:31.130
So I use the box to bring all these

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.210
components together.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.480
So if you view this whole box as one

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.670
model, it's just like any other

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.580
generative model.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.710
It would just give us the probability

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.440
of a word.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.890
But the way that determines this

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.230
probability is quite different from

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.970
when we have just one distribution.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.870
And this is basically a more

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.610
complicated mixture model.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.420
Sorry, more complicated model than just

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.410
one distribution, and it's called a

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.930
mixture model.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.100
So as I just said, we can treat this as

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.100
just a generative model and it's often

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.340
useful to think of just the likelihood

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.956
function.

00:07:07.956 --> 00:07:09.790
The illustration that you have seen

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.267
before, which is dimmer now is just the

00:07:12.267 --> 00:07:14.125
illustration of this generation model.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:16.645
So mathematically, this model.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:20.130
This is nothing but to just define the

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.010
following generative model where the

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.990
probability of word is assumed to be a

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.327
sum over 2 cases of generating the

00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:29.035
word.

00:07:29.035 --> 00:07:31.440
The form you're seeing now is more

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.540
general form than.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.840
what you have seen in the calculation earlier.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.080
I just used a simple w to denote any

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.460
word, but you can still see.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.490
This is basically the first sum.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:46.140
Like

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.035
And this sum is due to the fact that

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:51.880
the word can be generating multiple

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.310
ways.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.160
Two ways in this case.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.880
At inside sum, each term is a product

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.460
again of two terms.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.865
And the two terms are ,first, the

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:05.420
probability of selecting a component

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.890
like Theta sub D. Second, the

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.040
probability of actually observing the

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.270
word from this component model.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.455
And so this is a very general description

00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:19.420
of, in fact, all the mixture models.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.260
And I just want to make sure that you

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.480
understand this, because this is really

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.240
the basis for understanding all kinds

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.220
of topic models.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.488
So now once we set up the model and we

00:08:31.488 --> 00:08:33.470
can write down the likelihood function

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.930
as we see here, the next question is

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.140
how can we estimate the parameter or

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.370
what to do with the parameters given

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.350
the data?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.190
Well, in general we can use some

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.462
observed text data to estimate the

00:08:46.462 --> 00:08:48.560
model parameters and this mission

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.290
would allow us to discover

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.940
the interesting knowledge about the

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.770
text, so in this case, what do we

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.360
discover?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.470
Well, these are represented by our

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.555
parameters, and we have two kinds of

00:09:02.555 --> 00:09:02.970
parameters.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.840
One is the two word distributions.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.845
Those are two topics and the other is

00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:10.600
the coverage of each topic in each.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.800
The coverage of each topic and this is

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.220
determined by probability of Theta

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:17.610
sub D.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.230
and probability of Theta sub B.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.129
Note that they sum to one.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.360
Now what's interesting is also to think

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.010
about the special cases, like when we

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.530
set one of them to one.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.120
What would happen? Well, the other would

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.110
be 0, right?

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.790
And if you look at the likelihood

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.410
function.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.780
It will then degenerate to the special

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.370
case of just one distribution right so

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.960
you can easily verify that by assuming

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.000
one of these two is 1.0 and the other

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.110
is 0.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.480
So in this sense, the mixture model is

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.390
more general than the previous model

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.630
where we have just one distribution and

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.810
it can cover that as a special case.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.440
So to summarize, and we talked about

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.010
the mixture of two unigram language

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.490
models.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.890
And the data we consider here is

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.400
just still 1 document.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.350
And the model is a mixture model with

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.500
two components: two unigram language

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:14.990
models.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.140
Specifically, Theta sub D which is

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.330
intended to denote the topic of

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.530
document D and Theta sub B which is

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.430
representing a background topic

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.480
that we can set to attract the common

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.950
words.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.040
Because common words would be assigned

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.980
high probabilities in this model.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.110
So the parameters can be collectively

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.760
called a Lambda, which I show here

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.609
again, and you can again

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.160
think about the question about how many

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.580
parameters are we talking about

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.240
exactly.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.520
This is usually good exercise to do

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.750
because it allows you to see the model

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.970
index and to have a complete

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.455
understanding of what's going on in

00:10:55.455 --> 00:10:57.545
this model and we have mixing weights

00:10:57.545 --> 00:10:58.860
of course also.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.830
So what is the likelihood function look

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.000
like?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.904
It looks very similar to what we had

00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:09.565
before, so for the document, first, it's

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:12.136
a product of all the words in the

00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:14.003
document exactly the same as before.

00:11:14.003 --> 00:11:17.120
The only difference is that inside here

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.956
now it's a sum instead of just one,

00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:22.790
so you might recall before we just had

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.710
this one.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.489
But now we had this sum because of the

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.200
mixture model and because of the mixed

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:32.415
model

00:11:32.415 --> 00:11:33.690
We also have to introduce the

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.190
probability of choosing that particular

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.810
component distribution.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.069
And so this is just another way of

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:45.609
writing it again by using a product

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:47.779
over all the unique words in our

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:50.583
vocabulary, instead of having a product

00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:52.969
of all the positions in the document

00:11:52.969 --> 00:11:56.989
and this form where we look at

00:11:56.989 --> 00:11:59.859
different unique words is a convenient

00:11:59.859 --> 00:12:02.459
form for computing the maximum

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:04.039
likelihood estimator later.

00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:07.799
And the maximum likelihood estimatorÂ 

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:11.539
is, as usual, just to find the parameters

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:13.909
that would maximize this likelihood

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:15.959
function and the constraints

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:18.779
here, of course, are two kinds.

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:21.354
One is the word probabilities in each

00:12:21.354 --> 00:12:23.729
topic must sum to one, the other is the

00:12:23.729 --> 00:12:25.948
choice of each topic must sum to one.
