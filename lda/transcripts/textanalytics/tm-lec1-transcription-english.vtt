00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.800
In this lecture we give an overview of

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.910
text mining and analytics.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.682
First, let's define the term text

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.430
mining and the term text

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.423
analytics.

00:00:19.423 --> 00:00:22.550
The title of this course is called Text

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.500
Mining and Analytics,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.310
but the two terms text mining and text

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.070
analytics are actually roughly the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.040
same. So we are not going to really

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.710
distinguish them, and we're going to

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.450
use them interchangeably.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.150
But the reason why we have chosen to

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.630
use both terms in the title is because

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.660
there is also some subtle difference

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.400
if you look at the two phrases

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.160
literally.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.360
Mining emphasizes more on the process,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.030
so it gives us an algorithmic

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.350
view of the problem.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.770
Analytics on the other hand

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.960
emphasizes more on the result

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.060
or having a problem in mind.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.700
We're going to look at the text data

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.620
to help us solve a problem.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.410
But again, as I said, we can treat

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.280
these two terms roughly the same,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.440
and I think in the literature you

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.030
probably will find the same.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.300
So we're not going to really

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.870
distinguish them in the course.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.360
Both text mining and text analytics

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.290
mean

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.800
that we want to turn text data into

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.090
high quality information or actionable

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.740
knowledge.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.020
So in both cases we have the problem of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.070
dealing with a lot of text data and we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.850
hope to turn these text data into

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.170
something more useful to us than the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.260
raw text data.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.760
And here we distinguish two different

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.270
results

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240
one is high quality information,

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.630
the other is actionable knowledge.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.590
Now, sometimes the boundary between the two

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.840
is not so clear,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.310
but I also want to say a little bit

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.240
about these

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.650
two different angles of the result of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.600
text mining.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.100
In the case of high quality information

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.960
we refer to more concise

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.800
information

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.830
about the topic,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.880
which might be much easier for humans

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.000
to digest than the raw text data.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.850
For example, you might face a lot of

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.260
reviews of a product.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.880
The more concise form of the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.160
information would be very concise

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.620
summary of the major opinions about the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.860
features of the product.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.940
Positive about, let's say, battery life

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.790
of a laptop.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.360
Now, this kind of results are very

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.380
useful to help people digest text data,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.450
and so this is to minimize the human

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.670
effort in consuming text data in some

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.070
sense.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.010
The other kind of output is actionable

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.590
knowledge.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.410
Here we emphasize

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.290
the utility of the information or

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.380
knowledge we discover from text data.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.290
It's actionable knowledge for some

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.650
decision problem, or some actions to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.050
take.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.700
For example, we might be able to

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.680
determine which product is more

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.060
appealing to us all,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.800
a better choice for a shopping

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.380
decision.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.430
Now,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.950
such an outcome

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.630
could be called actionable

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.970
knowledge because a consumer can

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.190
take the knowledge and make a decision

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.500
and act on it.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.590
So in this case, text mining supplies

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.000
knowledge for optimal decision making.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.510
But again, the two are not so clearly

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.710
distinguished, so we don't necessarily

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.150
have to make a distinction.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.920
Text mining is also related to text

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.610
retrieval,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.890
which is an essential component in any

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.480
text mining systems.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.540
Now text retrieval refers to finding

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.270
relevant information from a large

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.580
amount of text data.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.660
So I've taught another separate MOOC

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.440
on text retrieval and search engines,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.500
where we discussed various techniques

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.860
for text retrieval.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.370
If you have taken that MOOC, you

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.210
will find some overlap

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.380
and it would be useful to know the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.950
background of text retrieval for

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.230
understanding some of the topics in

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.170
text mining.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.480
But if you have not taken that MOOC it's

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.210
also fine, because in this more context

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.560
mining and analytics we're going to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.940
repeat some of the key concepts that

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.390
are relevant for text mining.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.560
But at the high level, let me also

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.840
explain the relation between text

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.490
retrieval and text mining.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.465
Text retrieval is very useful for text

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:18.360
mining in two ways:

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.920
First, text retrieval can be a

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.450
pre-processor for text mining, meaning

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.160
that it can help us turn big text data

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.350
into a relatively small amount of most

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.670
relevant text data, which is often

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.710
what's needed for solving a particular

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.330
problem.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.070
And in this sense, text retrieval also

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.420
helps minimize human effort.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.120
Text retrieval is also needed for

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.730
knowledge provenance and this roughly

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.945
corresponds to the interpretation of

00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:54.320
text mining as turning text data into

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.030
actionable knowledge.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.719
Once we find the patterns in text data

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.030
or actionable knowledge,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.528
we generally would have to verify the

00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:05.296
knowledge by looking at the original

00:06:05.296 --> 00:06:07.847
text data so the users would have to

00:06:07.847 --> 00:06:09.950
have some text retrieval support to go

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.499
back to the original text data to

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.810
interpret the pattern, or to better

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.009
understand the knowledge or to verify

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.525
whether the pattern is really reliable.

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:21.636
So this is a high level introduction to

00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:24.390
the concept of text mining and

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.820
the relation between text mining and

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.690
retrieval.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.520
Next, let's talk about text data as a

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.370
special kind of data.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.600
Now it's interesting to

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.390
view text data as data

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.450
generated by

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.380
humans as subjective sensors.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.670
So this slide shows an

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.180
analogy between text data and non

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.730
text data and between humans as

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.426
subjective sensors and physical sensors

00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:13.160
such as network sensor or

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.900
thermometer.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.340
So in general, a sensor will monitor

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.720
the real world in some way it will

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.159
sense some signal from the real world

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.420
and then would report the signal as

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.670
data

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.980
in various forms, for example, a

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.170
thermometer would watch the temperature

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.640
of

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.920
real world and then will report the

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.390
temperature in particular format.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.320
Similarly a geo sensor would sense the

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.000
location and then report

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.120
the location specification, for example

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.860
in the form of longitude value and

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.940
lattitude value.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.750
Network sensor would monitor network

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.290
traffic or activities in the network

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.270
and report some digital format of data.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.410
Similarly, we can think of humans as

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.650
subjective sensors that would observe

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.770
the real world

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.890
from some perspective, and then humans

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.590
would express what they have observed

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.990
in the form of text data.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.370
So in this sense human is actually

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.560
a subjective sensor

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.590
that would also sense what's happening

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.120
in the world and then express what's

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.655
observed in the form of data,

00:08:39.655 --> 00:08:41.960
in this case text data.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.280
Now looking at the text data in this

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.720
way has the advantage of being able to

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.060
integrate all kinds of data together,

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.310
and that's indeed needed in most data

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.510
mining problems.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.330
So here we are looking at

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.560
the general problem of data mining,

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.730
and in general we would be dealing with

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.870
a lot of data about our world

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.080
that are related to a problem.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.910
And in general would be dealing with

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.420
both non text data and text data and of

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:19.710
course the non text data are usually

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.500
produced by physical sensors.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.350
And those non text data can be also of

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.340
different formats - 

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.410
numerical data or categorical or

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.750
relational data or multimedia data

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.380
like a video or speech.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.250
So, these non text data are often very

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.980
important in some problems.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.170
But text data is also very important,

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.150
mostly because they contain a lot of

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.910
semantic content and they often contain

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.350
knowledge about the users, especially

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.930
preferences and opinions of users.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.790
So, but by treating text data as the

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.403
data observed from human sensors, we

00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:10.560
can treat all these data together in

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.723
the same framework. So, data

00:10:14.723 --> 00:10:16.720
mining problem is basically to turn

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.150
such data, turn all the data into

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.100
actionable knowledge that we can take

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.200
the advantage to change the real world,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.565
of course, for better.

00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:30.020
So this means that data mining problem

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.789
is basically taking a lot of data as

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.330
input and giving actionable knowledge

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.460
as output. Inside the data mining

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.630
module

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.855
you can also see we have a number of

00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:46.134
different kinds of mining algorithms

00:10:46.134 --> 00:10:48.470
and this is because for different

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.388
kinds of data we generally need

00:10:51.388 --> 00:10:54.731
different algorithms for mining the

00:10:54.731 --> 00:10:55.399
data.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.110
For example, video data might require

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.460
computer vision to understand video

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:04.040
content and that would facilitate the

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.700
more effective mining and

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.660
we also have a lot of general

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.490
algorithms that are applicable to all

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.980
kinds of data, and those algorithms of

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.270
course are very useful,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.040
although for a particular kind of data

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.180
we generally want to also develop

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.300
special algorithms.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.440
So this course will cover specialized

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.990
algorithms that are particularly useful

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.470
for mining text data.
