00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.730
This lecture is about a specific

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.580
technique for contextual text mining

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.800
called contextual probabilistic latent

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.000
semantic analysis.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.630
In this lecture, we're going to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.690
continue discussing contextual text

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.100
mining.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.890
And we're going to introduce contextual

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.630
probabilistic

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.310
latent semantic analysis

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.610
As an extension of PLSA for doing

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.780
contextual text mining.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.200
Recall that in contextual text mining

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.389
we hope to analyze topics in text.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.540
In consideration of context so that we

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.710
can associate the topics with

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.350
appropriate context that we're

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.100
interested in.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.210
So in this approach contextualÂ 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.290
probabilistic latent semantic

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.330
analysis or CPLSA

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.840
The main idea is to explicitly add

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.010
interesting context variables into a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.930
generated model.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.870
Recall that before when we generate the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.110
text, we generally assume we will start

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.110
with some topics and then sample words

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.010
from some topics.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.950
But here we are going to add context

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.670
variables so that the coverage of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.660
topics and also the content of topics

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.670
will be tight little context.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.470
Or in other words, we can do let the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.000
context influence both coverage and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.240
content of a topic.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.420
The consequences that this would enable

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.270
us to discover contextualized topics

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.950
make the topics more interesting, more

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.365
meaningful, because we can then have

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:45.990
topics that can be interpreted as

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.010
specific to a particular context that

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.990
we're interested in.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.750
For example, a particular time period.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.460
As extension of PLSA model, CPLSA

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.900
mainly does the following changes.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.340
Firstly it would model the conditional

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.850
likelihood of text given context.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.369
That clearly suggests that the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.300
generation of text would then depend on

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.095
context, and that allows us to bring

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.770
context into the generative model.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.790
Secondly, it makes 2 specific

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.490
assumptions about the dependency of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.300
topics on context.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.965
One is to assume that depending on the

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:28.390
context depending on different time

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.306
periods or different locations, we

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:32.770
assume that there are different views

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.040
of the topic or different versions of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.675
word distributions that characterize a

00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:40.340
topic, and this assumption allows us to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.300
discover different variations of the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.943
same topic in different context.

00:02:45.943 --> 00:02:48.900
The other is that we assume.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.550
The topic coverage also depends on the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.220
context.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.140
And that means depending on the time or

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.520
location, we might cover topics

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.160
differently.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.995
And then again this dependency would

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:03.920
then allow us to capture the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.320
association of topics with specific

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.780
context.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.630
We can still use the EM algorithm to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.060
solve the problem of parameter

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.760
estimation.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.320
And in this case, the estimate premise

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.510
would naturally contain context

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.230
variables, and in particular a lot of

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.590
conditional probabilities of topics

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.450
given certain context.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.290
And this would allow us to do

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.440
contextual text mining.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.690
So this is the basic idea.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.330
Now we don't have time to introduce

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.050
this model in detail, but there are

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.925
references here that you can look into

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.879
to know more detail here.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.000
I just want to explain the high level

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.790
ideas in more detail, particularly

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.450
willing to explain the generation

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.440
process of text data that has context

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.490
associated in such a model.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.070
So as you see here, we can assume there

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.640
are still multiple topics.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.500
For example, some topics might

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.630
represent the themes like a government

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.766
response donation or the city of New

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:14.139
Orleans.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.190
Now this example is in the context of

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.779
Hurricane Katrina and that hit New Orleans.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.200
Now, as you can see, we assume there

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.210
are different views associated with the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.600
each of the topics.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.615
And these are shown as view one, view two and

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:37.420
view three

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.530
Each view is a different version of

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.690
word distributions.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.390
And these views are tide to some

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.640
context variables.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.616
For example, type to the location Texas

00:04:46.616 --> 00:04:51.360
or the time July 2005 or the occupation

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.550
of the other being sociologist.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.450
Now on the right side you see now we assume the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.380
document has contact information, so

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.270
the time is known to be July 2005,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.110
location is Texas, etc.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.210
Now such context information is what we

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.365
hope to model as well.

00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:12.950
So we're not going to just model the

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.370
text.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.490
And so one idea here is to model the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.990
variations of topic content in

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.820
different context and this gives us

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.250
different views of the world

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.080
distributions.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.260
Now on the bottom you will see the

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.660
theme coverage or topic coverage might

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.920
also vary according to these context.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.680
Because in the.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.290
In the case of location like Texas,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.460
people might want to cover the red

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.340
topics more at the new audience, as

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.460
visualized here.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.600
But in a certain time period, maybe

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.510
particular topic like donation will be

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.000
covered more so this variation is also

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.350
considered in CPLSA.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.590
So to generate such a document with

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.940
context, we first also choose a view.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.420
And this view of course now could be

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.940
from any of these contexts.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.470
Let's say we have taken this view.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.620
That depends on the time in the middle.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.660
So now we have a specific version of

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.435
word distributions.

00:06:21.435 --> 00:06:23.420
Now you can see some probabilities of

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.210
words for each topic.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.570
Now, once we have chosen a view, now

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.000
the situation will be very similar to

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.015
what happened in standard PLSA.

00:06:34.015 --> 00:06:36.000
We assume we have got a word

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.170
distribution associated with each

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.990
topic, right?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.040
And then next to the view we choose a

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.820
coverage from the bottom.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.810
So we're going to choose particular

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.170
coverage and that coverage.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.120
Before is fixed in PLSA and it's hard to

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.020
a particular document.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.940
Each document has just one coverage

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.640
distribution.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.120
Now here, because we consider context

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.735
so the distribution of topics or the

00:07:03.735 --> 00:07:06.340
coverage of topics can vary depending

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.650
on the context that has influenced the

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.010
coverage.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.790
So, for example, we might pick a

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.100
particular coverage, let's say in this

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.540
case.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.530
We pick

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.560
We've picked the document specifically

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.920
coverage now with the coverage and

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.700
these word distributions, we can

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.410
generate the document in exactly the

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:26.970
same way as in PLSA.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.067
So what it means we're going to use the

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:32.830
coverage to choose a topic to choose

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.130
one of these three topics.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.702
Let's say we have picked up, let's say,

00:07:36.702 --> 00:07:40.000
the yellow topic, then withdraw a word

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.710
from this particular topic on the top.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.060
So we might get the word

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.070
like government.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.240
And then next time we might choose a

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.150
different topic, an will get donate,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.990
etc right until we generate all the

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.810
words and this is basically the same

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.760
process as in PLSA.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.450
Now, so the main difference is when we

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.780
obtain the coverage and the word

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.490
distributions, we let the context

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:10.900
influence our choice.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.580
So in other words, we have extra

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.506
switches that are tied to this context

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:18.010
that would control the choices of

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.285
different views of topics and choices

00:08:20.285 --> 00:08:21.250
of coverage.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.982
And naturally, the model will have more

00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:26.100
parameters to estimate, but once we can

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.986
estimate those parameters that involve

00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:29.810
the context, then we will be able to

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.466
understand the context of

00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:33.745
specific views of topics or context of

00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:35.706
specific coverages of topics.

00:08:35.706 --> 00:08:37.770
And this is precisely what we want in

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.050
contextual text mining.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.300
So here are some sample results from

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.310
using such a model.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.990
Not necessary exactly the same model,

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.870
but similar models.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.213
So on this slide you see some sample

00:08:50.213 --> 00:08:52.500
results of comparing news articles

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.170
about Iraq war and Afghanistan war.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.850
Now we have about 30 articles.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.190
On Iraq war and 26 articles on

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.140
Afghanistan war.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.890
Now, in this case, the goal is to.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.460
To review the common topics covered in

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.230
both sets, articles and the differences

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.479
or variations of the topic in each of the

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.450
two collections.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.170
So in this case, the context that is

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.960
explicitly specified by the topical

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.550
collection.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.840
And we see the results here show that.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.010
There is a common theme that's

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.150
corresponding to cluster around here in

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.970
this column.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.474
That there is a common theme indicating

00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:41.070
that United Nations is involved in both

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.979
wars is a common topic covered in both

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.430
sets of articles, and that's indicated

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.790
by the high probability words shown here

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.870
United Nations.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.876
Now if you the background, of course

00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:56.040
this is not surprising and this is.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.700
This topic is indeed very relevant,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.350
to both wars.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.160
If you look at the column further and

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.560
what's interesting is that the next two

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.570
cells of word distributions actually

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.520
tell US collection specific variations

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.580
of the topic of United Nations.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.694
So it indicates that in Iraq war,

00:10:16.694 --> 00:10:18.879
United Nations was more involved in

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.160
weapon inspections, whereas in

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.770
Afghanistan war it was more involved in

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.930
maybe aid to Northern Alliance as a

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.523
different variation of the topic of

00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:29.089
United Nations.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.970
So this shows that by bringing the

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.730
context, in this case, different wars

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.290
are different collections of text.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.750
We can have topic variations, tied to

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.690
these contexts to review the

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.430
differences of coverage of United

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.340
Nations in the two wars.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.870
Similarly, if you look at the second

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:48.570
cluster.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.610
Cluster 2 has to do with the killing

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.840
of people and again.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.020
Not surprising if you know the background

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.427
about wars or the wars involved

00:10:57.427 --> 00:10:58.530
killing of people.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.270
But imagine if you are not familiar

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.180
with the text collections or have a lot

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.840
of text articles and such a technique

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.760
can review the common topics covered in

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.220
both sets of articles.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.298
It can be used to review common topics

00:11:12.298 --> 00:11:14.890
in multiple sets of articles as well.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.480
If you look down, of course in that

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.370
column of cluster 2 you see variations

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.310
of killing of people and that

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.620
correspond to in different different

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.300
contexts.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.940
And here is another example of results.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.390
Obtain the front block articles about

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.620
the Hurricane Katrina.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.610
Now in this case, what you see here is

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.010
visualization of the.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.280
trends of topics overtime.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.790
And the top one shows just the temporal

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.890
chains of two topics.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.360
One is oil price and one is.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.090
about the flooding of the city.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.030
New Orleans.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.080
This these topics are obtained from

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.810
block articles about the Hurricane

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:06.510
Katrina.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.430
And people talked about these topics.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.720
And in addition to some other topics.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.220
But the visualization shows that with

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.740
this technique that we can have

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.310
conditional distribution of time given

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.930
a topic.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.380
So this allows us to plot this

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.440
conditional probability.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.060
General curves like what you're seeing

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.500
here.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.300
We see that initially the two curves

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.850
tracked each other very well. But later we see the topic of New Orleans was mentioned again but oil price was not

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.540
and

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.990
This turns out to be the time period

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.740
when another Hurricane Hurricane Rita

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.240
hit the region that apparently tricked

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.065
more discussion about the flooding of

00:12:52.065 --> 00:12:52.620
the city.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.400
The bottom curve shows the coverage of

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.280
this topic about the flooding of the

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.620
city by block articles in different

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.010
locations and also shows some shift of

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.720
coverage.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.600
That might be related to peoples

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:17.670
migrating from the state of Louisiana

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.350
to Texas, for example.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.360
So in this case we can see the time can

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.670
be used as context to reveal trends of

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.220
topics.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.470
This is some additional result on

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.450
special patterns and this.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.890
In this case it's about the topic of

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.930
government response.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.030
And there was some criticism about the

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.180
slow response of government in the case

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.230
of Hurricane Katrina, and discussion

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.730
now is covered in different locations

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.030
and these visualizations show the

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.100
coverage in different weeks of the

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.090
event, and initially it's covered

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.789
mostly in the victim states in the

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.570
South, but then gradually it's

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.870
spreading to other.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.870
Locations, but in week four, which is

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.220
shown on the bottom on the left, we see

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.810
a pattern that's very similar to the

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.710
very first week on the top left, and

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.250
that's why again the hurricane Rita

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:17.970
hit the region.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.700
So such a technique would allow us to

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.170
use location as context to examine

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.630
variations of topics.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.710
And of course, the model is completely

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.630
general, so you can apply this to any

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.450
other collections of text to reveal

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.860
spatial temporal patterns.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.610
Is yet another application of this kind

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.626
of model where we look at the use of

00:14:39.626 --> 00:14:42.010
the model for event impact analysis.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.610
So here we are looking at the research

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.000
articles in information retrieval, IR,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.640
particularly SIGIR papers.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.712
And the topic we focus on is about

00:14:51.712 --> 00:14:53.960
the retrieval models and you can see

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.620
the top word top words with high

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.219
probability is about this model on the

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.630
left.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.975
And then we hope to examine the impact

00:15:02.975 --> 00:15:04.050
of two events.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.230
One is the start of TREC for text

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.170
retrieval conference.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.980
This is a major evaluation effort

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.570
sponsored by US government and was

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.110
launched in 1992 or around that time

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:19.120
and that is known to have made an

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.850
impact on the topics of research

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.950
information retrieval.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.540
The other is the publication of a

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.386
Seminal paper by Croft and Ponte, and

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:30.390
this is about the language modeling

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.860
approach to information retrieval.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.780
It's also known to have made a high

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.420
impact on information retrieval

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.830
research, so we hope to use this kind

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.980
of model, understand impact, and the

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.530
idea here is simply to use the time as

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.600
context an use these events to divide

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.757
the time periods into a period before

00:15:48.757 --> 00:15:51.340
the event an another after this event,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.130
and then we can compare the differences

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:53.720
of.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.800
The topics, the coverage and

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.023
variations, etc.

00:15:57.023 --> 00:15:59.840
So in this case the results show I've

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.554
seen that before TREC the study of

00:16:02.554 --> 00:16:04.760
retrieval models was mostly a vector

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.690
space model, Boolean model, etc.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.920
But the after TREC.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.868
Apparently the study of retrieval

00:16:10.868 --> 00:16:12.860
models have involved a lot of other

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.470
words that seem to suggest some

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.460
different retrieval tasks though.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.320
So for example email was used in the

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.540
enterprise search tasks and subtropical

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.530
retrieval, with another task introduced

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.190
later by

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.690
TREC.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.770
On the bottom we see the variations

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.870
that are correlated with the

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.360
publication of the language model

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:35.790
paper.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.100
Before we have those classical

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.050
probabilistic model logic model,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.630
Boolean model etc.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.230
But after 1998 that we see clear

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.746
dominance of language model as

00:16:48.746 --> 00:16:51.480
probabilistic models and we see words

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.010
like a language model, estimation of

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.410
parameters etc.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.710
So this technique here can use event as

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:59.510
context.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.000
To understand the impact of event

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.090
again, the technique is general so you

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.369
can use this to analyze the impact of

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:08.170
any event.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.290
Here are some suggested readings.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.680
The first is

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.730
paper about simple extension of PLSA to

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.170
enable cross collection comparison.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.335
It's to perform comparative text mining

00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:25.270
to allow us to extract the common

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.440
topics shared by multiple collections

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.530
and their variations in each

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.060
collection.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.730
The second one is the main paper about

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.545
the CPLSA model with a discussion of

00:17:36.545 --> 00:17:37.620
a lot of applications.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.740
The third one has a lot of details

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.930
about this special temporal patterns

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.770
for Hurricane Katrina, example.
