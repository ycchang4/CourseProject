00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.530
This lecture is a summary of this whole

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.170
course.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.030
First, let's revisit the topics that we

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.990
covered in this course.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.650
In the beginning, we talked about the

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.510
natural language processing and how it

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.360
can enrich text representation.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.570
We then talked about how to mine

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.100
knowledge about the language, natural

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.550
language used to express what's

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.410
observed in the world of text data.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.580
And in particular, we talked about how

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.450
to mine word associations.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.349
We then talked about how to analyze

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.630
topic syntax, how to discover topics,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.380
and analyze them.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.402
This can be regarded as knowledge about

00:00:49.402 --> 00:00:51.570
the oberved of the world, and then we

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.833
talked about how to mine knowledge

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:56.170
about the observer and particularly

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.930
talk about how to mine opinions and do

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.130
sentiment analysis.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.620
And finally, we talked about the text

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.230
based prediction, which has to do with

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.160
predicting values of other real world

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.640
variables based on text data.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.970
And in discussing this, we also

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.630
discussed the rule of non-text data which

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.146
can contribute to additional predictors

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:22.210
for the prediction problem and also it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.450
can provide a context for analyzing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.300
text data.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.965
And in particular, we talked about how

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:30.080
to use context to analyze topics.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.920
So,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.456
here are the key high-level takeaway

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:38.900
messages from this course.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.830
I'm gonna go over each of these major

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.800
topics and point out what are the key

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.970
takeaway messages that you should

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.700
remember.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.790
First in NLP and text representation,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.510
you should realize that NLP is

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.560
always very important for any text

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.863
applications because it enriches text

00:01:58.863 --> 00:02:01.353
representation the more NLP, better

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.570
text representation we can have and this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.640
further enables more accurate knowledge

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.980
discovery, to discover deeper knowledge

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.980
buried in text.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.670
However, the current state of the art

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.740
of natural language processing is still

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.370
not robust enough, and so as a result,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.690
the robust text mining

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.020
technologies today tend to be based on

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.512
word representation and tend to rely a

00:02:28.512 --> 00:02:31.230
lot on statistical analysis, as we

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.900
have discussed in this course. You may

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.940
recall we mostly used word based

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.236
representations, and we've relied a lot

00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:42.610
on statistical techniques, 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.450
on statistical learning techniques

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.110
particularly.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.830
In Word Association Mining and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.680
analysis, 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.920
the important points are first are we

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.430
introduced the two concepts for two

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.810
basic plan complementary relations of

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.330
words, paradigmatic and syntagmatic

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.980
relations.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.990
These are actually very general

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.960
relations between elements in any

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.860
sequences. If you take it as meaning

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.650
elements that occur in similar context

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.090
in the sequence and elements that tend

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.220
to co-occur with each other and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.510
these relations might also be

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.280
meaningful for other sequences of data.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.805
We also talked a lot about the text

00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:31.086
similarity when we discuss how to

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.940
discover paradigmatically relations, we

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.780
compare their context of words,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.400
discover words that share similar

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.647
contexts. At that point that we talked

00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:43.010
about, representing text data with a

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.730
vector space model, and we talked about

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.255
some retrieval techniques such as BM25

00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:51.800
for measuring similarity of text and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.660
for assigning weights to terms, TF-IDF

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.690
weighting, etc.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.990
And this part is well connected to text

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.420
retrieval.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.110
There are other techniques that can be

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.610
relevant here also.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.590
The next point that is about the co-

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.750
occurrence analysis of text and we

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.790
introduced some information theory

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.170
concepts such as entropy, conditional

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.020
entropy and mutual information.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.430
These are not only very useful for

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.570
measuring the co-occurrences of words,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.709
and they're also very useful for

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.532
analyzing other kind of data, and

00:04:25.532 --> 00:04:27.270
they're useful for example for feature

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.410
selection in text categorization as

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.830
well.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.150
So this is another important concept to

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.580
know.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.560
And then we talked about the topic mining and

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.080
analysis and that's where we introduced

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.430
the probabilistic topic model.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.040
We spend a lot of time to explain the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.550
basic topic model PLSA in detail.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.140
And this is also the basis for

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.790
understanding LDA, which is a

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.180
theoretically more appealing model.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.600
But we did not have enough time to

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.650
really go in depth in introducing LDA.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.660
But in practice, PLSA seems as

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.440
effective as LDA, and it's simpler

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.260
to implement.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.630
It's also more efficient.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.290
In this part we also introduce some

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.830
general concepts that would be useful

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.400
to know.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.450
One is generating model and this is a

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.740
general method for modeling text data

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.390
and modeling other kinds of data as

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.850
well.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.640
And we talked about the maximum likelihood

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.965
estimator and the EM algorithm for solving

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:33.860
the problem of computing maximum

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.160
likelihood estimator.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.840
So these are all general techniques

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.960
that tends to be very useful in other

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.100
scenarios as well.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.888
Then we talked about the text

00:05:42.888 --> 00:05:44.710
clustering and text categorization.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.120
Those are two important building blocks

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.860
in any text mining application systems.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.319
In text clustering we talked about the,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.840
how we can solve the problem by using a

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.696
slightly different than mixture model

00:05:58.696 --> 00:06:01.720
than the probabilistic topic model.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.690
And we then also briefly reviewed some

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.880
similarity based approaches

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.120
to text clustering.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.730
In categorization, we also talked about

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.310
the two kinds of approaches.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.860
One is generative classifiers, they

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.160
rely on base rule to infer the

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.910
conditional probability of a category

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.140
given text data.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.030
In particular, we introduced Naive

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.450
Bayes in detail.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.930
This is a

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.400
practical, useful technique for a lot of

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.770
text categorization tasks.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.780
We also briefly introduce some

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.710
discriminative classifiers,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.340
particularly logistical regression K

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.990
nearest neighbor and SVN.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.850
There also very important that they are

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.580
very popular and they're very useful

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.650
for text categorization as well.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.310
In both parts we also discussed how to

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.160
evaluate the results, and evaluation is

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.640
quite important because if the measures

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.770
that you use don't really reflect the

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.870
utility of the method, then it would

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.280
give you misleading results.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.460
So it's very important to get

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.410
evaluation right and we can talk the

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.410
about evaluation of categorisation in

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.600
detail with a lot of specific measures.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.780
Then we talked about the sentiment

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.970
analysis and opinion mining, and that's

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.140
where we introduced sentiment

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.480
classification problem.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.675
And although it's a special case of

00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:32.483
text categorization, but we talked about

00:07:32.483 --> 00:07:35.430
how to extend or improve the text

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.800
categorisation method by using more

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.930
sophisticated features that would be

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.722
needed for sentiment analysis.

00:07:41.722 --> 00:07:43.970
We did the review of some commonly used

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.500
the complex features for text analysis

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.560
and then we also talked about how to

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.390
capture the order of these categories

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.040
in sentiment classification, and in

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.710
particular we introduced the ordinal

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.900
logistical regression.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.880
Then we also talk about latent aspect

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.140
rating analysis.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.370
This is unsupervised way of using a

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.410
generated model to understand the

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.905
review data in more detail.

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:09.060
In particular, it allows us to

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.130
understand the decomposed ratings of reviewer

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.620
on different aspects of the

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.160
topic.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.810
So given text reviews with overall

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.810
ratings, the method would allow us to

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.959
infer the ratings on different aspects.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.440
And it also allows us to infer the

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.080
reviewers latent

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.160
weights on these aspects on which

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.590
aspects are more important to the

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.290
reviewer, can be reviewed as well, and

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.430
this enables a lot of interesting

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:39.210
applications.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.580
Finally, in the discussion of text

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.210
based prediction, we mainly talked

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.185
about the joint mining of text and non

00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:49.250
text data as they are both very

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.490
important for prediction.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.360
And we particularly talked about how text

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.770
data can help non text data and vice

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.730
versa. In the case of using non text

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.940
data to help the text data analysis,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.840
we talked about the contextual text

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.300
mining.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.100
We introduce the contextual PLSA as a

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.547
generalization or generalized model of

00:09:09.547 --> 00:09:11.420
PLSA to allow us to incorporate

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.260
context variables such as time and

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.746
location and this is a general way to

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:17.840
allow us to review a lot of interesting

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.659
topical patterns in text data.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.270
We also introduced the net PLSA.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.770
In this case we use social network or

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.780
network in general of text data to help

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.560
analyzing topics.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.810
And finally we talked about how time

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.330
series data can be used as context to

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.360
mine, potentially causal topics in text

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.760
data.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.080
Now in the other way of using text to

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.750
help,

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.120
to help interpreting patterns discovered

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.390
from non text data,

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.260
we did not really discuss

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.540
anything in detail but just provide the

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.300
reference, but I should stress that

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.670
that's actually very important

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.750
direction to know about

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.710
if you want to build a practical text

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.990
mining systems, because understanding

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.320
and interpreting patterns is quite

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.010
important.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.320
So this is a summary of the key

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.050
takeaway messages.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.002
And, I hope these would be very useful

00:10:21.002 --> 00:10:23.260
to you for building any text mining

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.900
applications or doing further study of

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.540
these algorithms and this should

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.830
provide a good basis for you to read

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.073
Frontier Research papers

00:10:31.073 --> 00:10:34.005
to know about more advanced algorithms

00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:37.610
or to invent new algorithms yourself.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.860
So to know more about this topic, I

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.610
would suggest you to look into other

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.700
areas in more depth.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.115
And during this short period of time of

00:10:51.115 --> 00:10:53.185
this course, we could only touch the

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:55.710
basic concepts, basic principles of

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.870
text mining and we emphasize the

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.905
coverage of practical, useful

00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:04.810
algorithms, and this is at the cost of

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.396
covering some more advanced algorithms

00:11:07.396 --> 00:11:10.460
only briefly, or in many cases we

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.535
omitted the discussion of a lot of

00:11:12.535 --> 00:11:13.310
advanced algorithms.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.510
So to learn more about this subject,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.206
you should definitely and learn more

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:20.650
about the natural language processing,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.390
because this is the foundation for all

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.561
text based applications.

00:11:23.561 --> 00:11:27.180
The more NLP you can do, the better

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.360
representation of texts that you can

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.993
get and then the deeper knowledge you

00:11:30.993 --> 00:11:32.300
can discover.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.130
So this is very important.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.530
The second area that you should look

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.533
into is statistical machine learning

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.079
and

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.300
these techniques are now the backbone

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.230
techniques for not just text analysis

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.920
applications, but also for NLP.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.340
A lot of NLP techniques are nowadays

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.165
actually based on supervised machine

00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:55.470
learning.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.820
So they are very important 

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.370
because they are key to also

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.190
understanding some advanced NLP

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.330
techniques and naturally they would

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.290
provide more tools for doing text

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.490
analysis in general.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.330
Now,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.162
a particularly interesting area called

00:12:14.162 --> 00:12:16.700
Deep Learning has attracted a lot of

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.470
attention recently.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:20.250
It has also shown promise in many

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.010
application areas, especially in speech

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:24.920
and vision, and it has been applied to

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:26.505
text data as well.

00:12:26.505 --> 00:12:28.545
So, for example, recently there has

00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:30.710
been work on using deep learning to do

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.580
sentiment analysis to achieve better

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.440
accuracy, and so that's one example of

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.530
advanced techniques that we weren't

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.330
able to cover.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.110
But that's also very important.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.660
And the other area that has emerged in

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.830
statistical learning is the word embedding

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.050
technique where they can learn vector

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.610
representation of words and then these

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.165
vector representations would allow you

00:12:53.165 --> 00:12:55.100
to compute the similarity of words.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.390
As you can see, this provides directly

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.310
a way to discover potentially

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.090
paradigmatically relations of words and

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.760
results that people have got so far

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.600
are very impressive.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.290
That's another promising technique that

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.620
we did not have time to touch.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.280
But of course, whether these new

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.930
techniques would lead to practical use

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.800
for techniques that work much better

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.800
than the current technologies,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.940
is the open question that has to be

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.550
examined.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.500
And no serious evaluation has been done

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.140
yet in, for example, examining the

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.480
practical value of word embedding other

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.150
than word similarity based evaluation.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.660
But nevertheless, these are advanced

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.225
techniques that surely will make impact

00:13:41.225 --> 00:13:43.360
in text mining in the future.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.090
So it's very important to know more

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.030
about these.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.620
Statistical learning is also key to

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.440
predictive modeling, which is very

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.400
crucial for many big data applications.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.727
We did not talk about that predictive

00:13:54.727 --> 00:13:56.640
modeling component, but this is mostly

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.140
about the regression or categorization

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.030
techniques, and this is another reason

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.170
why statistical learning is important.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.860
We also suggested you to learn more

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.310
about data mining, and that's simply

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.370
because general data mining algorithms

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.460
can always be applied to text data

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.030
which can be regarded as a special case

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.840
of general data.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.150
So there are many applications of data

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.770
mining techniques in particular, for

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.520
example, a pattern discovery would be

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.040
very useful to generate a interesting

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.250
features for text analysis.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.670
Recently, information network mining

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.660
techniques can also be used to analyze

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.040
text information network.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.270
So these are all good to know in order

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.750
to develop effective text analysis

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.280
techniques.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.340
And finally, we also recommend you to

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.860
learn more about the text retrieval

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.640
information retrieval or search

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.260
engines.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.940
And this is especially important if

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.180
you're interested in building practical

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.940
text data application systems.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.360
And a search engine would be essential

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.490
system component in any text based

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.783
applications, and that's because text

00:15:09.783 --> 00:15:13.110
data are created for humans, to us to

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.740
consume.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.470
So humans are at the best position to

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.079
understand the text data.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.149
It's important to have human in the

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.859
loop in a big text data applications.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.140
So it can in particular help text

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.860
mining systems in two ways.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.219
One is to effectively reduce the data

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.800
size from a large collection to a small

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.016
collection with the most relevant text

00:15:38.016 --> 00:15:41.450
data that only matter for the

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.000
particular application.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.170
So the other is to provide a way to

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.020
annotate it, to explain patterns, and

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.070
this has to do with knowledge

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:50.680
provenance.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.529
Once we discover some knowledge, we

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.110
have to figure out whether the

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.610
discovery is really reliable and so we

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:58.260
need to go back to the original text

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.765
that are verified and that's when

00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:01.360
the search engine is very important.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.610
Moreover, some techniques and

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.555
information retrieval, for example BM

00:16:07.555 --> 00:16:10.270
25, vector space and language models,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.310
also very useful for text data mining.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.300
We only mention some of them, but if

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.070
you know more about the text retrieval,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.440
you'll see that there are many

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.230
techniques that are useful.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.250
Another technique that's useful is

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.890
indexing technique that enables quick

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.610
response of search engine to users

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.795
query and such techniques can be very

00:16:28.795 --> 00:16:30.770
useful for building efficient text

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.330
mining systems as well.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.690
So finally I want to remind you of this

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.790
big picture for harnessing big text

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.730
data that I showed you at the very

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.130
beginning of the semester.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.800
So in general, to build a big text data

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.470
application system, we need two kinds

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.170
of techniques, text retrieval and text

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.560
mining.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.500
And text retrieval as I explained, is to help

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.490
convert the big text data into a small

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.400
amount of most relevant data for a

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.920
particular problem, and can also help

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.900
providing knowledge prominence, help

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.540
interpreting patterns later.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.230
Text mining has to do with further

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.780
analyzing the relevant data to discover

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.670
the actionable knowledge that can be

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.400
directly useful for decision making or

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.830
many other tasks.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.330
So this course covered text mining, and

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.560
there's a companion course called text

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.920
retrieval and search engines that

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.400
covers text retrieval.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.380
If you haven't taken that course, it

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.960
would be useful for you to take it,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.810
especially if you are interested in

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.760
building a text application system and

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.740
taking both courses would give you a

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.135
complete set of practical skills for

00:17:42.135 --> 00:17:43.880
building such a system.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.550
So in very end I just would like to

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.425
thank you for taking this course.

00:17:50.425 --> 00:17:53.570
I hope you have learned useful

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.600
knowledge and skills in text mining and

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.170
analytics.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.643
As you see from our discussions, there

00:17:59.643 --> 00:18:01.785
are a lot of application opportunities

00:18:01.785 --> 00:18:03.520
for this kind of techniques, and there

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.850
are also a lot of open challenges, so I

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.315
hope you can use what you have learned

00:18:09.315 --> 00:18:11.270
to build a lot of useful applications

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.540
to benefit the society and to also join

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.036
the research community to discover new

00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:20.520
techniques for text mining and analytics.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.330
Thank you.
