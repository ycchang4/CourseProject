00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.470
This lecture is about the contextual

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.180
text mining.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.440
Contextual text mining is related to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.400
multiple kinds of knowledge that we

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.730
mine from text data.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.600
As I'm showing here, is related to

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.030
topic mining because can make topics

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.200
associated with context, like a time or

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.419
location, and similarly it can make

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.630
opinion mining more contextualized,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.700
making opinions connected to context.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.630
It's related to text based

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.280
prediction because it allows us to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.640
combine non text data with text data

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.180
to derive sophisticated predictors

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.840
for the prediction problem.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.110
So more specifically, why are we

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.780
interested in contextual text mining?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.140
Well that's, first,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.860
because text often has rich context

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.470
information and this can include

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.610
direct context such as meta data.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.040
And also indirect context, so the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.850
direct context can include the meta-data

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.910
such as time, location,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.810
authors, and source of the text data.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.910
And they almost always available to us.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.983
Indirect text context refers to

00:01:16.983 --> 00:01:18.950
additional data related to the meta

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.415
data.

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:22.760
So, for example, from authors, we can

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.840
further obtain additional context, such

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.686
as social network of the author or the

00:01:28.686 --> 00:01:31.810
author's age. And such information is not,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.320
in general, directly related to the text

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.190
yet through the authors we can connect

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.250
them.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.200
There could be also other text data

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.182
from the same source as this one, so

00:01:42.182 --> 00:01:44.560
the other context data can be connected

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.460
with this text,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.930
as well. So in general, any related

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.610
data can be regarded as context, so

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.300
there could be remotely related to context.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.930
context.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.040
And so what's the use of,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.050
why is text context useful?

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.770
Well, context can be used to

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.490
partition text data in many

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.780
interesting ways.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.940
It can almost allows partition text

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.490
data in arbitrary ways as we need. And

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.763
this is very important because this

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:15.670
allows us to do interesting comparative

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.420
analysis.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.185
It also in general provides meaning to

00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:21.740
the discovery topics if we gonna

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.830
associate the text with context.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.870
So here's illustration of how context

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.920
can be regarded as interesting ways of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.250
partitioning of text data. So here I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.060
just show some research papers

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.650
published in different years.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.640
on different venues, different conference

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.020
names here listed on the bottom, like

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.110
SIGIR, ACL, etc.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.090
Now, such text data can be partitioning in

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.870
many interesting ways because we have

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.560
context.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.780
So the context here just includes time

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.350
and the conference venues.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.470
And but perhaps we can include some

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.120
other variables as well.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.040
But let's see how we can partition data

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.910
in interesting ways.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.480
First, we can treat each paper as a

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.730
separate unit.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.936
So in this case, a paper ID and each

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:18.700
paper has its own context, it's

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.460
independent.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.000
And.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.720
But we can also treat all the papers

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.210
written in 1998 as one group, and this

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.709
is only possible because of the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.889
availability of time and we can

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.350
partition data in this way.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.570
This would allow us to compare topics,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.380
for example in different years.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.600
Similarly, we can partition the data

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.880
based on the venues.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.460
We can get all the SIGIR papers and

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.850
compare those papers with the rest or

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.210
compare SIGIR papers with KDD papers

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.570
with ACL papers.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.590
We can also partition the data to

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.030
obtain the papers written by authors in

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.990
the US, and that of course uses

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.120
additional context.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.280
of the authors and this would allow us

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.170
to then compare such a subset with

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.350
another set of papers written by authors

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.510
in other countries.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.499
Or we can obtain a set of papers about

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.330
the text mining, and this can be

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.820
compared with papers about another topic.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.495
topic.

00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:24.109
And note that these partitioning can be

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.940
also intersect with each other to

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.530
generate even more complicated

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.170
partitions.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.830
And so in general, this enables

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.230
discovery of knowledge associated with

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.060
different context as needed.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.260
And in particular, we can compare

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.310
different contexts, and this often

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.338
gives us a lot of useful knowledge.

00:04:43.338 --> 00:04:46.280
For example, comparing topics overtime,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.035
we can see trends of topics and

00:04:49.035 --> 00:04:51.280
comparing topics in different context

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.600
can also reveal differences about the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.650
two contexts.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.000
So there are many interesting questions

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.590
that require contextual text mining

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.580
here, I list some very specific ones.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.960
For example, what topics have been

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.555
gaining increasing attention recently

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.060
in data mining research?

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.070
Now to answer this question, obviously

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.400
we need to analyze text in the context

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.510
of time.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.590
So time is a context in this case.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.670
Is there any difference in the

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.140
responses of people in different

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.770
regions to the event, to any event?

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.870
So this is a very broad analysis

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.390
question, in this case, of course,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.880
location is the context.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.120
What are the common research interests

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.866
of two researchers?

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:33.540
In this case, authors can be the

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.020
context.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.590
Is there any difference in the research

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.080
topics published by authors in the USA

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.040
and those outside?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.337
Now, in this case, the context would include

00:05:42.337 --> 00:05:45.570
the authors and their affiliation and

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:46.180
location.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.850
So this goes beyond just the author

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.650
himself or herself.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.070
We need to look at the additional

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.800
information connected to the author.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.010
Is there any difference in the opinions

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.100
about the topic expressed on one social

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.340
network and another?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.390
In this case, the social network of

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.300
authors and the topic can be the

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.980
context.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.540
Are there topics in news data that are

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.810
correlated with sudden changes in stock

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.170
prices?

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.680
In this case, we can use a time series

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.180
such as stock prices as context.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.330
What issues mattered in the 2012

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
presidential campaign or presidential

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.900
election?

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.960
Now in this case, time series again as context.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.660
df

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.370
So, as you can see, the list can go on

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.990
and on, basically contextual text

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.140
mining can have many applications.
