00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.720
This lecture is about the future of web

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.170
search.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.020
In this lecture we're going to talk

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.760
about some possible future trends of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.620
web search and intelligent

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.080
information retrieval systems in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.680
general.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.040
In order to further improve the

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.220
accuracy of search engines, it's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.640
important to consider special cases of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.180
information need, so one particular

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.660
trend could be to have more and more

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.220
specialized and customized search

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.883
engines and they can be called vertical

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:44.689
search engines.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.120
These vertical search engines can be

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940
expected to be more effective than the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.500
current general search engines because

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.380
they could assume that the users are a

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.700
special group of users that might have

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.345
a common information need, and then the

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:05.180
search engine can be customized to serve

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.070
such users.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.860
And because of the customization is

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.420
also possible to do personalization, so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.860
search can be personalized.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.170
Because we have a better understanding

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.240
of the users.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.186
Because of the restriction of the domain,

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.690
we also have some advantages in

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.728
handling the documents because we can

00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:29.530
have better understanding of documents.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.930
For example, particular words may not

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.305
be ambiguous in such a domain, so we

00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:36.950
can bypass the problem of ambiguity.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.100
Another trend that we can expect to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.030
see is

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450
The search engine will be able to learn

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.480
over time.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.170
It's like a lifetime learning or

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.280
lifelong learning.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.480
And this is of course very attractive,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.100
because that means the search engine

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.480
will self improve itself as more people

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.252
are using it.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.009
Search engines will become better and

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.943
better and this is already happening

00:02:02.943 --> 00:02:04.885
because search engines can learn from

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:07.860
the implicit feedback, more users use

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.529
it and the quality of the search

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.810
results for the popular queries that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.200
are typed in by many users will likely

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.040
become better.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.530
So this is another feature that we

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.060
would see.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.400
The third trend might be the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.490
integration of multi models of

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.480
information access.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.100
So search navigation and recommendation

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.650
or filtering might be combined to form

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.440
a full fledged information management

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.050
system.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.990
And in the beginning of this course we

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.330
talked about the push versus pull.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.699
These are different modes of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.270
information access, but these modes can

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.290
be combined.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.352
And similarly, in the pull mode,

00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:52.730
querying and browsing could also be

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.650
combined then in fact we're doing

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.130
that basically today with the current

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.453
search engines we are querying.

00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:02.010
Sometimes browsing, clicking on links.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.155
Sometimes we've got some information

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:06.460
recommended, although most of the cases

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.600
information recommended is because of

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.400
advertising.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.020
But in the future you can imagine

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.980
seamlessly integrate the system with

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.260
multi mode for information access.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.080
And that would be convenient for

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.620
people.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.300
Another trend is that we might see

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.860
systems that try to go beyond, search

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.780
it supports the user tasks.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.212
After all, the reason why people want

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:37.010
to search is to solve a problem or to

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.990
make a decision or perform a task.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.520
For example, consumers might search for

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.430
opinions about products in order to

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.370
purchase a product and choose a good

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.440
product to buy.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.895
So in this case it would be beneficial

00:03:49.895 --> 00:03:52.830
to support the whole workflow of

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.180
purchasing a product or choosing a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.520
product.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.460
In this area, after the current search

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.040
engines already provided good support,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.950
for example, you can sometimes look at

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.930
the reviews and then if you want to buy

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.970
it and you can just click on the button

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.340
to go to the shopping site

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.570
directly, get it done.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.040
But it does not provide a good task

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.658
support for many other tasks.

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:14.990
For example for researchers, you might

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.750
want to find the relevant literature or

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.010
site of the literature, and then

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.310
there's no support for finishing tasks

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.550
such as writing a paper.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.350
So in general, I think there are many

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.330
opportunities to innovate, and so in

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.110
the following a few slides I would be

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.670
talking a little bit more about some

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.820
specific ideas or thoughts that

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.330
hopefully you can help you imagine new

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.875
application possibilities.

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:46.380
Some of them might be already relevant

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.520
to what you are currently working on.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.100
In general, you can think about any

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.520
intelligent system, especially intended

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.703
information system, as being specified by

00:04:59.703 --> 00:05:03.420
these three nodes, and so if we connect

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.115
these three into a triangle, then we'll

00:05:06.115 --> 00:05:08.736
be able to specify information system,

00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:11.336
and I call this data user service

00:05:11.336 --> 00:05:12.003
triangle.

00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:14.350
So basically the three questions you

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.100
ask would be who are you serving and

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.160
what kind of data you are managing.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.730
And what kind of service you provide?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.060
Right there, this would help us

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.880
basically specify your system and there

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.265
are many different ways to connect

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.050
them, depending on how you connect

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.660
them, you will have a different kind of

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.233
system, so let me give you some example.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:38.150
On the top,

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.490
you can see different kinds of users, on

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.160
the left side you can see different

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.480
types of data or information, and on the

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.530
bottom you can see different service

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.650
functions.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.970
Now imagine we can connect all these in

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.650
different ways.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.169
So for example if you can connect

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.860
everyone with web pages.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.160
And the support search and browsing.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.080
What do you get?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.130
That's web search, right?

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.710
What if we connect the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.090
UIUC employees with organization

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.077
documents or enterprise documents to

00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:10.590
support the search and browsing.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.623
That's enterprise search.

00:06:11.623 --> 00:06:15.030
If you connect the scientists with

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.260
literature information to provide all

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.530
kinds of service, including search,

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.663
browsing or alert of new relevant

00:06:23.663 --> 00:06:26.600
documents, or mining, analyzing

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.256
research trends, or provide the task

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:31.350
support or decision support, for

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.510
example.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.696
You might be might be able to provide a

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:38.890
support for automatically generating

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.570
related work section for research

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.240
paper, and this would be closer to task

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.610
support, right?

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.420
So then we can imagine this would be a

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.660
literature assistant if we connect to

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.700
online shoppers with blog articles or

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.580
product reviews, then we can help these

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.060
people to improve shopping experience

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.900
so we can provide for example data

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.095
mining capabilities to analyze the

00:07:05.095 --> 00:07:05.970
reviews to

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.870
Compare products, compare sentiment of

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.010
products and to provide a task support or

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.010
decision support to help them choose

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.370
what product to buy.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.700
Or we can connect the customer service

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.560
people with emails from the customers.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.965
And we can imagine a system that can

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:28.590
provide analysis of these emails to

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.260
find the major complaints of the

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.110
customers.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.750
We can imagine the system could provide

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.640
task support by automatically generating a response

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.080
to the customer email, or maybe

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.280
intelligently attach also promotion.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.430
Message if appropriate if the detector

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.790
that's a positive message, not a

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.330
complaint, and then you might to take

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.400
this opportunity to attach some

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.230
promotion information.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.225
Whereas if it's a complaint that you

00:07:57.225 --> 00:07:58.260
might be able to.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.730
Automatically generate some generic

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.980
response first and tell the customer that

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.600
he or she can expect the detailed

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.240
response later, etc.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.890
All these are trying to help people to

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.310
improve the productivity.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.720
So this shows that the opportunities

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.590
are really a lot, it's just only

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.136
restricted by our imagination.

00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:26.130
So this picture shows the trend of the

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.650
technology and also it characterizes

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.990
the intelligent information system in

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.160
three angles you can see in the center

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.620
there is a triangle that connects

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.510
keyword queries to search and bag of

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.495
words representation.

00:08:41.495 --> 00:08:44.290
That means the current search engines

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.910
basically provides search support.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:52.090
Users and mostly model users based on

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.170
keyword queries.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.940
And it sees the data through a bag of

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.110
words representation.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.960
So it's a very simple approximation of

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.580
the actual information in the

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.320
documents.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.840
But that's what the current system

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.380
does.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.340
It connects these three nodes in such a

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.990
simple way.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.220
Or it only provides you basic

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.923
search function and doesn't really

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:18.620
understand the user.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.579
And it doesn't really understand it

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:20.980
that much

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.020
information in the documents.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.690
Now I showed some trends to push each

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.300
node.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.280
Toward more advanced function, so think

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.620
about the user node here so we can go

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.950
beyond the keyword queries.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.050
Look at the user search history and

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.020
then further model the user completely

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.770
to understand the users task,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.560
environment, task need context or

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.924
other information.

00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:53.730
So this is pushing for personalization

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.836
and complete the user modeling and this

00:09:55.836 --> 00:09:57.620
is a major direction in research.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.845
In order to build intelligent

00:09:59.845 --> 00:10:00.980
information systems.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.640
On the document side.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.560
We can also see we can go beyond bag of

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.810
words representation to have entity

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.230
relation representation.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.170
This means we'll recognize peoples names

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.520
their relations, locations etc and this is

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.460
already feasible with today's natural

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.480
language processing technique and

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.240
Google's recent initiative on the

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.340
Knowledge Graph.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.370
If you have heard of it, it's a good

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.885
step toward this direction and once we

00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:31.400
can get to that level of representation

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.220
in a robust manner at large scale, it can

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.950
enable the search engine to

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.640
provide much better service. In the

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.400
future,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.810
we would like to have knowledge

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.750
representation where we can add perhaps

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.910
inference rules and then the search

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.920
engine will become more intelligent.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.730
So this calls for large scale semantic

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.470
analysis, and perhaps this is more

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.180
feasible for vertical search engines.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.510
It's easier to make progress in a

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.670
particular domain. Now on the service

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.620
side, we see that we need to go beyond

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.470
the search if support information

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.390
access in general, so search is only

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.840
one way to get access to information as

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.140
well.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.390
Recommender systems and push and pull

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.610
are different ways to get access to

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.945
relevant information, but going beyond

00:11:20.945 --> 00:11:22.780
access we also need to help people

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.330
digest information.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.930
Once the information is found and this

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.870
step has to do with

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.160
analysis of information or data mining.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.710
We have to find the patterns or

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.410
converted the text information into

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.689
your knowledge that can be used in

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.180
application

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.193
or actionable knowledge that can be

00:11:41.193 --> 00:11:43.170
used for decision making. And

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:45.270
furthermore the knowledge would be used

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.530
to help user to improve productivity in

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.860
finishing a task.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.965
For example, a decision making task.

00:11:51.965 --> 00:11:55.635
So this is a trend and so basically in

00:11:55.635 --> 00:11:57.350
this dimension we

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.710
anticipate in the futur.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.230
Intelligent Information systems will

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.350
provide intelligent and interactive

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.820
task

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.030
support. Now I should also emphasize

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.025
interactive here because it's important

00:12:10.025 --> 00:12:13.420
to optimize the combined

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.305
intelligence of the users and the

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:19.432
system so we can get some help from

00:12:19.432 --> 00:12:23.000
users in some natural way and we don't

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.670
have to assume the system has to do

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.600
everything when the human user and the

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.260
machine

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.750
can collaborate in an intelligent way

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.320
in an efficient way, then the combined

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.770
intelligence will be high and in

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.650
general we can minimize the user's

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.250
overall effort in solving problem.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.740
So this is the big picture of future

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.640
intelligent information systems.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.700
And this hopefully can provide us some

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.560
insights about how to make further

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.700
innovations on top of what we can do

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.160
today.
