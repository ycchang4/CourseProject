00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.505
So to summarize, our discussion of

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.330
recommender systems in some sense, the

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.230
filtering task or recommending task is

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.402
easy and in some other senses, and the

00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:13.730
task is actually difficult, so it's

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.150
easy because the users expectations,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.340
though in this case the system it takes

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.308
initiative to push the information to

00:00:21.308 --> 00:00:23.890
the user so the user doesn't really

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.390
make.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.820
An effort, so any recommendation is

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.635
better than nothing, right?

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:40.110
So unless you recommend the order,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.490
noisy items or useless documents, if

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.340
you can recommend some useful

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.400
information, users general would

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.410
appreciate it, so that's in that sense

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.270
that's easy.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.100
However, filtering is actually much

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.120
harder task than retrieval because it

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.262
has you have to make a binary decision

00:00:58.262 --> 00:01:00.950
and you can't afford waiting for a lot

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.563
of items.

00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:03.230
And then you're going to see.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.280
whether 1 item is better than others.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.010
You have to make a decision when you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.430
see this item.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.650
The thing about the news filtering as

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.403
soon as you see the news and you have

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:15.070
to decide whether the news would be

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.520
interesting to a user.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.400
If you wait for a few days.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.780
Even if you can make accurate

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.066
recommendation of the most relevant

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.290
news, the utility is going to be

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.760
significantly decreased.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.980
Another reason why it's hard, it's

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.486
because the data sparseness.

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:33.900
If you think of this as a learning

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.980
problem in collaborative filtering, for

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.210
example, it's purely based on learning

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.630
from the past ratings, so if you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.740
don't have many ratings, this really

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.100
not that much you can do.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.580
And yeah, just mentioned this cold

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.306
start problem.

00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:53.837
This is actually a very serious serious

00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:56.125
problem, but of course there are

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.370
strategies that have been proposed to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.210
solve the problem and there are

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.456
different strategies that you can use

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:04.880
to alleviate the problem.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.263
You can use for example, more user

00:02:07.263 --> 00:02:09.540
information to assess their similarity

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.655
instead of using the preferences of

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:15.520
these users on these items, there may

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.090
be additional information available

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.170
about the user.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.010
etc and.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.540
And we also talked about the two

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.170
strategies for filtering task one is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.160
content based, where we look at item

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.060
similarity.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.953
The other is collaborative filtering where

00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:35.120
we look at the user similarity and they

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.070
obviously can be combined in a

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.970
practical system.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.040
You can imagine the general would have

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.260
to be combined so that will give us a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.689
hybrid strategy for filtering.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.640
And we also could recall that we talked

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.930
about push versus pull as two

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.369
strategies for getting access to the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.290
text data and recommended system is to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.340
help users in the push mode and search

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.860
engines are certain users in the pull

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.550
mode.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.337
Obviously the tool should be combined

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:11.142
and they can be combined to have a

00:03:11.142 --> 00:03:13.270
system that can support the user

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.130
with multiple mode information access.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.470
So in future we could anticipate the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.400
such a system to be more useful to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.090
user.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.000
An either this is the active research

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.872
area, so there are a lot of new

00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:32.940
algorithms being proposed all the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.570
time.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.010
In particular, those new algorithms

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.180
tend to use a lot of context

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.970
information.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.230
Now the context here could be the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.056
context of the user and that it could

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.370
be also context of documents or items.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.780
The items are not isolated and they are

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.440
connected in many ways.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.050
The users might form social network

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.490
as well, so there's a rich context

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.430
there that we can leverage in order to

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.560
really solve the problem well and then

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.090
that's an active research area where also

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.640
machine learning algorithms that have

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.250
been applied.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.090
Here are some additional readings in

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.485
the Handbook called Recommender Systems

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:21.490
and has a collection of a lot of good.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.985
Articles that can give you an overview

00:04:24.985 --> 00:04:29.410
of a number of specific approaches to

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.090
recommended systems.
