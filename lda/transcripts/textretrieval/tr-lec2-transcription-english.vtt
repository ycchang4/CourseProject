00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.460
In this lecture we're going to talk

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.020
about text access.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.333
In the previous lecture we talk about

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.695
natural language content analysis.

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:21.930
We explained that the state of the art

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.870
natural language processing techniques

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.320
are still not good enough to process a

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.140
lot of unrestricted text data in a

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.460
robust manner.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.210
As a result, bag of words

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.840
representation remains very popular in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.580
applications like search engines.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.360
In this lecture we're going to talk

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.460
about some high level strategies.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.000
To help users get access to the text

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.430
data.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.580
This is also important step to convert

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.960
raw big text data into small relevant

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.670
data that are actually needed in a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.900
specific application.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.220
So the main question we will address here is

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.600
how can a text information system help

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.240
users get access to the relevant

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.630
text data we're going to cover two

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.210
complementary strategies, push versus

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.730
pull.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.390
And then we're going to talk about the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.480
two ways to implement the pull mode:

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.180
querying versus browsing.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.060
So first push versus pull.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.600
These are two different ways to connect

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.466
users with the right information at the

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.090
right time.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.320
The difference is.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.070
Which takes the initiative.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.830
Which party takes the initiative?

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.640
In the pull mode, the users would take

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.500
the initiative.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.100
To start the information access

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.670
process.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.420
And in this case, a user typically

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.305
would use a search engine to fulfill

00:01:52.305 --> 00:01:53.100
the goal.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.880
For example, the user may type in the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.630
query and then

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.520
browse results to

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.780
find the relevant information.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.220
So this is usually appropriate for

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.050
satisfying a users

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.470
Ad hoc information need.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.420
An ad hoc information need is

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.430
temporary information need, for

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.180
example.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.020
You want to buy a product so you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.900
suddenly have a need to read reviews

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.080
about related products.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.050
But after you have collected

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.880
information and have purchased your

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.320
product.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.090
You generally no longer need such

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.480
information, so it's a temporary

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.360
information need.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.050
In such a case, it's very hard for a

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.230
system will predict your need and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.890
it's more appropriate for the users to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.110
take the initiative, and that's why

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.550
search engines are very useful today

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.670
because many people have many ad hoc

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.850
information needs all the time.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.000
So as we're speaking Google is probably

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.740
processing many queries from us and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.580
those are all or mostly all ad hoc

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.700
information needs.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.963
So this is a pull mode in contrast, in the

00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:02.720
push mode, the system will take the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.754
initiative to push the information to

00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:06.257
the user, or to recommend that

00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:07.207
information to the user.

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:09.370
So in this case this is usually

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.270
supported by a recommender system.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.320
Now this would be appropriate if the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.085
user has a stable information need.

00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:20.160
For example, you may have a research

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.350
interest in some topic and that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.070
interest tends to stay for awhile, so

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.750
it's relatively stable.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.472
Your hobby is another example of a

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:30.500
stable information need.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.250
In such a case, the system can interact

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.530
with you and can learn your interest

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.290
and then can monitor the information

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.750
stream.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.390
If it is, the system has seen any

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.293
relevant items to your interest

00:03:43.293 --> 00:03:45.140
the system could then take the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.393
initiative to recommend information to

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:47.829
you.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.180
So for example, a news filter or news

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.047
recommender system could monitor the

00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:53.944
news stream and identify interesting

00:03:53.944 --> 00:03:56.219
news to you and simply push the news

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.020
articles to you.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.200
This mode of information access maybe

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.720
also appropriate when the system has

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.150
good knowledge about the users need and

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.980
this happens in the search context.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.702
So for example, when you search for

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:11.770
information on the web, a search engine

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.410
might infer you might be also

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.230
interested in some related information.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.660
And they would recommend the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.230
information to you, so that should

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.890
remind you, for example advertisement

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.980
placed on search page.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.760
So this is

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.270
about the two high level strategies or

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.640
two modes of text access.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.100
Now let's look at the pull mode in more

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.640
detail.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.750
In the pull mode, we can further

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.670
distinguish in two ways to help users

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.300
querying versus browsing.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.070
In querying the user will just enter a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.730
query.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.150
Typical keyword query and the search engine

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.916
system would return relevant documents

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:53.689
to users.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.040
And this works when the user knows what

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.600
exactly are the keywords to be used.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.290
So if you know exactly what you're looking

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.000
for, you tend to know the right

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.750
keywords, and then querying would work

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.130
very well and we do that all the time.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.320
But we also know that sometimes it

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.685
doesn't work so well, when you don't know

00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:16.130
the right keywords to use in the query

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.380
or you want to browse information in

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.390
some topic area.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.860
In this case browsing would be more

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.560
useful.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.750
So in this case.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.330
In the case of browsing, the users

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.650
would simply navigate into the relevant

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.200
information by following the paths

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.360
supported.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.330
By the structures documents.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.820
So the system would maintain some kind

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.390
of structures and then the user could

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.390
follow these structures to navigate.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.830
So this really works well when

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.290
the user wants to explore the information

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.970
space.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.000
Or the user doesn't know what are the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.040
key words to use in the query.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.450
Or simply because the user finds it

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.029
inconvenient to type in a query.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.149
So even if the user knows what query to

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.240
type in, if the user is using a cell

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.670
phone.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.570
To search for information there, it's

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.170
still hard to enter the query in such a

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.400
case.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.410
Again, browsing tends to be more

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.090
convenient.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.865
The relationship between browsing and

00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:22.350
the query is best understood

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.290
by making an analogy to sight seeing.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.830
Imagine if you are touring the city

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.042
now.

00:06:27.042 --> 00:06:30.470
If you know the exact address of the attraction

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:30.980
then

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.768
taking a taxi, there is perhaps the

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.940
fastest way you can go directly to the

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.130
site, but if you don't know the exact

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.660
address you may need to walk around, or

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.780
you can take a taxi to a nearby place

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.520
and then walk around.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.129
It turns out that we do exactly the

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.800
same in the information space.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.075
If you know exactly what you're looking for,

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:52.770
then you can use the right keywords in

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.796
your query to find the information

00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:55.309
directly.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.610
That's usually the fastest way to do

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.700
find information.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.110
But what if you don't know the exact

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.040
keywords to use?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.990
Your query probably won't work, so

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.223
you'll land on some related pages, and

00:07:06.223 --> 00:07:08.525
then you need to also walk around in

00:07:08.525 --> 00:07:11.000
the information space, meaning by

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.020
following the links or by browsing.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.780
You can then finally get into the

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.630
relevant page.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.030
If you want to learn about the topic again

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.300
you will likely do a lot of browsing.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.125
So just like you are looking around in

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:30.130
some area and you want to see some

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.650
interesting attractions in a related-

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.080
in the same region.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.680
So this is analogy also tells us that

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.330
today.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.250
We have very good spot for query but we

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.990
don't really have good support for

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.680
browsing.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.880
And this is because.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.955
In order to browse effectively, we need

00:07:54.955 --> 00:07:56.480
a map to guide us.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.696
Just like you need a map of Chicago to tour

00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:01.515
the city of Chicago, you need a topic map

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:03.340
to tour the information space.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.250
So how to construct such a topic map is

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.590
in fact a very interesting research

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.930
question that likely will bring us more

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.360
interesting browsing experience on the

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.130
web or in other applications.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.460
So to summarize this lecture we've

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.620
talked about the two high level

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.660
strategies for text access, push and

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.150
pull.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.840
Push tends to be supported by

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.720
recommender systems and pull tends to be

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.670
supported by a search engine.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.480
Of course in a sophisticated

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.830
intelligent information system we

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.000
should combine the two.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.070
In the pull mode we can further

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.780
distinguish querying and browsing

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.760
again, we generally want to combine the

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.020
two ways to help users so that you can

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.230
support both querying and browsing.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.590
If you want to know more about the

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.940
relationship between pull and push.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.460
You can read this article.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.960
This gives excellent discussion of the

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.590
relationship between information

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.600
filtering and information retrieval.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.430
Here, information filtering is similar

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.930
to information recommendation or the

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.850
push mode of information access.
