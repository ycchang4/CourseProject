welcome everybody today lot taking midterm good luck youre taking midterm today class gonna continue discussion objects monday introduced syntax use declare new type java limitation operating till point types data work removed design types model fit data want work program hopefully class today little time exercise think lets come world piece real world data want work figure model program right little review time java syntax allows programmer declare new type new type variable refer types variables objects program c line im saying class thats sort thinking night mean theres sort sort deep ontological concerns right class represents type thing world right case im im giving person follows class definition probably hits im gonna use model information people things class definition variables associated instance class object created type person program going age initialization declaration class valid age declared zero look better way slides object state information im storing point way couple string piece data like person want use types information store model store data declare particular type java object provides certain functionality certain things declaring methods class declaration line simontann im declaring methods called print doesnt return takes arguments simply prints person object second called birthday thats function increments age person youll dont use keyword line 9 line 12 valid talk minute java resolves names executing compiling functions included class declaration okay want explicit im referring use special keyword called reserved word language im running function thats class refers instance class thats running function use refer instance variables case dimensions class time width height area function returning area particular dimensions width times height refers instance class particular object thats executing method associated instance class area instance class cant function ive created object type works like said dont need use okay version clearer cleaner java run code right weird right strange different function functions weve looked wonder know job youre running code youre trying compile code start compiling area function takes arguments theres local variables declared function refer width height variables come java compiler compiles code remember thats stage execute comes variable says okay interesting theres theres function variable called width says local variable function called width thats defined inside function body answer parameter function called width maybe maybe function parameters youve decided place looks class definition says okay theres parameters function theres local variables declared let look dimensions class method defined find called width sure dimensions class width thing want explain gonna youre gonna rest rest semester java class function write java class variable declare inside function local variable declared class wondering code write inside function defined class wondering examples slides like started like thats cover slide todays lecture lets look oh actually ones good dont think good weve playing games weve performing trickery code youve running playground point allowing want sure clear confusing start use new examples java valid java declare function cant declare function outside class valid java code thats going run cant declare whats called loose code outside function cant declare function outside class hiding point confusing dont want coming day 1 looking class declaration method declaration like system dot dot print line helloworld like thats frightening weve playing games allow work little bit simplified environment java strict rules moments cant function outside class try compile intellij android studio wont work right getting away weve playing games point forward examples going look little bit different point weve letting write loose code outside class declaration point like work okay able print line statement oh come friend lets gets finished running longer going work okay code write inside class declaration im frightened isnt running let try reloading happens okay let outside sure breaks oh somethings wrong runner okay later right thats clearly going work anymore produce error message fix later right going forward true day forward playground examples class going format gonna start showing build class declarations theres little little bit magic wont understand like class heres whats gonna happen run code playground execution gonna start main method example class point want methods write code want thats things going start going run loose code thats outside okay nice thing multiple classes inside multiple classes inside playground right wanted declare dimensions class thats going work going use advantage start new panels ok heres heres example new format similar time want looks little bit different im declaring dimensions class width width height area method returns area particular dimensions object im creating new dimensions object good review line 11 im creating im declaring new variable type dimensions remember create types type im calling example right syntax weve use new keyword class thats looks lot like function right ive got ive got curly brace parentheses theres inside sort looks like method method gonna explain whats happening minute im studying width height dimensions object im calling area method expecting result want sure works good okay lets talk special method okay thing right new syntax creating object java new keyword says want create new object use class parentheses fact method looks like special method thats called called constructor implies constructs new instance type object type class new instance class constructor responsible initial setup needs create object initialize properly heres example constructors methods class special syntax okay whoo thats valid constructor tell weird yeah return type aha thats correct constructors declare return type reason return new instance object thats thing dont dont return inside constructor happens automatically theres return type theres constructor yeah yeah shares class exactly class called course instructor constructor share exact means case java start method uppercase letter typically classes going start uppercase letters thats naming convention thats know object instead primitive type constructor needs named class constructor going start capital letter constructors responsible initial setup order create new instance class new object type class case im saying want create instance type course course constructor youre gonna pass parameter right constructors like methods overload create want different type signatures special thing constructors thats obvious declaration run constructor theyre run object created like method class multiple_times constructor gets called object created called later constructor methods class later cant constructor reiterate pointed constructor named class declared return returns new instance type object create constructors classes type initialization required create valid instance class constructor create design classes opportunity choices things like default settings different fields certain fields required create instance object things like right okay like functions like said minute ago overload constructors youll typically find classes multiple different constructors different method signatures ive got different constructors im saying hey want create course object instance type course create pass ill use set course want dont know constructor ill set string ive got different constructors called depending arguments pass guys constructors couldnt lot cases want use constructor constructor bits special variable refers instance class use like minute ive simplified example minute ago constructor sets constructor thats constructor takes arguments calls constructor takes argument argument thats string start constructor set constructor arguments ends string gonna example minute wonder weve objects till point weve dimension object playing stuff like didnt provide constructor dont provide constructor java simply initialize fields object dont provide constructor theres default constructor think okay default constructor added java dont provide constructors thing point soon provide constructing instructor lose constructor constructor provided theres constructors typically want use constructor doesnt useful okay typically define class things java argue kind broken required provide constructor class constructor helpful right let let example ill come insect okay come talk minute okay lets ive got person class lets im gonna know im gonna use usual fields im gonna persons gonna lets lets use double age multiple precise point havent provided constructor think value code work going display think value age going guess yeah zero yeah uninitialized value double numeric types zero remember constructor didnt constructor doesnt set fields dont set look online java documentation page dont set value double defaults zero thats okay guess dont know like reasonable default value heres problem think going yeah yeah lets find going null objects class like create new lets create new example public class dimensions accept lets change course wouldnt people dimensions guess thats know yeah object thats uninitialized variable set null thats problem know want like set string figure length runtime error reasons important write constructors dont write use constructor end values fields helpful cause errors okay lets provide constructor class right gonna person default gonna behave way write constructor class initialization right kind cool thing soon provide constructor takes argument lets provide lets require set age person create oh wrong apologize think whats happening errors arent shown properly sad fix class wish noticed right whats going happen theres gonna compiler error compiler gonna going tell cant constructor anymore youve declared constructor feel okay want work im going actually wifi working step let switch slot x fine think right right im okay good im gonna age ill ill write constructor sets age agency quota set age set report lets print happens okay apologize air playground clearly need test little bit valid age good right pass thats know method right pass string im going right result lets imagine add field lets person want require set change constructor requires fields work named ling print length good okay questions minute lets write second constructor fun quickly question lets want case set person hes default value age im gonna primary constructor default argument constructors allow create instance class create instance class question yeah ah right okay question main method parameter called unused designed match way main method_works run actual java program taught talked talked main couple classes yeah yeah sew okay happens lets lets happens constructor gets called lets print line statement okay angry today fine going good right example let maybe time im talking playground recovered right things constructors thats interesting potentially problematic right return instance class theres way fail cant use return statement inside constructor gonna run im gonna gonna return new instance object setup said dont wont theres way return particular cant fail constructor going return new instance class lets pass bad arguments whats example bad argument pass set 10 people 10 okay dont judge yeah yeah pass null variable essentially im thing happening trying avoid im feel pretty confident person maybe null string null thats okay dont judge shouldnt problem passed know normally function guys write homework problems quizzes tell handle bad value youre supposed respond constructor doesnt guys dont good way constructor return new instance object dont set names going null set null going options achieved thing talk come talk static methods couple classes later semester discuss exceptions couple strategies avoiding problem okay oh going need questions constructors talk visibility little bit know guy dont want know guys feel like mysterious constructors method write runs code happens special method gives chance specific initialization want time new instance object great yeah whats know yeah constructor called theres way method later method constructor gets called new keyword create instance object theres way know sad stalled playground like example set person method takes string set double set age work difference method ive declared class use later right person object playground didnt hate dot setup person pass wanted yeah cant constructor theres stopping creating constructor uses field oh yeah doesnt way java compiler works method order classes yeah think python problem job yeah ah good question okay need set constructor private public use keywords gonna_talk disability sec constructor oh man okay im gonna use private constructor definitely feel like constructor default public im sure im gonna look use visibility hours constructors wonder declare constructor private turns valid arguments come talk way talk static okay questions constructors like said know point semester know tricky objects thinking model data conceptually challenging stuff weve code super simple right mean setting fields objects right lets talk little bit visibility john refers access modifiers guys started know notice wondered little bit lets talk little bit actually youre designing class things want want control class want control run certain methods want control set certain fields java provides called access modifiers use instance variables instance methods data algorithms method referred access modifiers actually gonna look right public private theyre actually theres called protected theres called packaged private essentially including access modifier confusing lets focus public private public private sort think based mark method instance variable public allows anybody instance class use variable modify retrieve method ive got public class person ive decided designed class reason want anybody able modify ive marked explicitly public want methods methods defined class able change age private doesnt mean variable modified wouldnt sense instead private means methods class allowed retrieve modify value particular variable age variable set retrieved methods defined class okay ran following code created new person line seven modify thats okay mark public try retrieve age thats gonna cause compiler error compiler gonna age marked private code running inside class okay public variable read written private variable read written methods defined class oh lord lets gonna spring life nope bear second im nervous wifi gone let reconnect access point website anybody okay sweet makes happy right think online happen like 30 seconds lets far okay lets declare lets lets lets example eclair lets declare age lets declare public age private lets set equal test sure code compiles lets print good okay lets try setting age hope probably isnt gonna crash yeah yeah think think crashing system public string private int age set age gonna gonna hang changed public set retrieve age second ago right day im gonna questions constructors oh wait okay isis bonfire sorry yeah right gonna stick looking examples today modify like dark ages like years ago playground modify add private access mod variable cant change variable anymore right outside piece code okay public anybody read write variable private variable read written methods find class okay trust works apply access modifiers functions methods define class meaning similar function like theres set run function mark method public anybody execute line 10 gonna work fine print marked public line 12 hand going fail print marked private public anybody run private run methods class example print print cant outside class right believe couple access modifiers exist java world called protected lying theres called packaged private makes sense little bit notion packages right come later semester okay let common pattern ive told point weve declared class wanted use variables find class declared public anybody set variables thats typically java fact try default check style rules little different playground default checks rules complain cant shouldnt create public instance variables weird right like store information class pattern java community arrived interesting original java language specification common pattern look jvm languages emerged like kotlin scala groovy follow pattern ok heres heres design pattern theres rules convention strong convention want store data class following create private variable store data line person gonna age dont let set marking public instead mark private create functions functions specific signatures gonna gonna guys write later quizzes homework problems point gonna tell right getter variable expect looks exactly like okay line called setter set followed variable returns takes argument type variable change modify function use set value age okay great known setter line retrieve value private change cant write separate function line thats called getter followed variable return variable im requesting type returns type variable okay built languages inherited java built java pattern follow okay private variable functions functions boilerplate fact intellij generate functions android studio theres way know generate constructor variable produce getters setters sorry getters setters verb right wonder like weird id mark public okay piece code marked public good lines extra code ive introduced problem gonna clear little bit early today class coming exam im gonna leave cliffhanger question thats answered slide pick friday right havent taken midterm good luck office hours today 1 3 playground right class hope guys great thursday
right everybody welcome today lot im gonna started gonna continue talking java objects today gonna continue looking organize objects hierarchies concept inheritance started looking monday gonna introduce interesting features goes hierarchies ability work entire group java classes shares similar features comes javas inheritance system works actually write code works entire category different types java objects having know exactly kind object taking advantage feature javas object model called polymorphism big word sounds little scary gonna demystify going connect beautiful theory programming languages area alright let talk whats gonna happen couple dates points semester sense people little tired little grumpy midterms classes stuff like projector grumpy clearly right heres gonna friday today going talk polymorphism gonna look review stuff inheritance introduced monday friday gonna break class class friday wont guy class bad thing guys applaud like makes feel little bad okay cool dont like book dont like class alright hopefully like little bit come office hours youll definitely like alright yeah day sleep 1100 mean yeah sleep till noon office hours mp1 know lot people making good progress mp finish having class today friday okay monday kind little bit slow session review java objects mop missed today ill examples weeks homework problems work cases confused wednesday talking polymorphous alright important topic want sure clear okay time talked inheritance introduced new keyword java allows establish relationships new java classes creating moving fast right getting exciting broke open javas type system got build types java declaring class showing java particular type object supposed behave thats cool establish relationships classes going gonna going talk going little come clear useful particular actually section semesters machine project youre going youre going kind unify code target mode worked mp0 area mode youre working think share lot common features turns later checkpoints going refactor code pull common pieces youre going utilize concept probably talking today know jabbas object hierarchy jonathas type system general building programs interface real world able work entities world real world entities described single value single integer value single double value actually combine different types data reasonable job representing person representing know sports team representing particular item clothing selling website know type things want work programs need way represent job class system allowing suit allow model real world data javis class system allows model relationships data world hierarchies families groups know theres power able organize things categories groups like reasons example zoologists spent time centuries maintaining tree tries organize life earth zoologist im gonna names right like families families species order genera like latin words idea know theres relationships organisms start know big categories displaying ignorance think theres know big categories different types organisms break smaller smaller groups right trying identify common features things heres example know pulled online right know things mammal mammals theres lot mammals examples mammals certain types creature subdivide right example cat fee uh known fela forms entire category creature includes domestic house cat know lions tigers panthers stuff like way know laughing today comment kitt clear caps actually pet cat happens wake morning find like idea happened right think think happened night cat dont remember maybe left mark right thing java reason work data programs natural want express kind taxonomy relationships actually find real world data real world entities allows youre going organize projects ways allow reuse code multiple classes classes starting share lot common functionality lot times thats theyre different kinds thing create thing theyre kind pull functionality superclass parent class children know implement additional functionality ill example sounds abstract actually pretty pretty practical okay heres javas object tree actually thing way small laptop piece java code java class java classes wanted think organize type data structure commonly known tree talk trees later class talk data structures trees typically looked upside want actually think sort roots right parent class java java follow tree eventually special class called object talk minute tiny little piece entire java class hierarchy actually know theres imagine theres character class okay character type thing want model world characters entire class entities break characters different types character characters represent numerical quantity refer digits ability represent numerical quantities digits letters dont know languages know separation exists languages maybe maybe clear know latin alphabet certain characters represent digits characters arent words youre like lead speak like right divide character digits letters right divide letters certain latin alphabet english centreright letters refer vowels letters refer consonants right depending function spoken language probably doesnt match languages type taxonomy language need differently okay example tree let know maybe seen let sure clear whats happening nodes parent digits parent class character carrots parent class characters parent classes object im finding children particular class digit declared extend character letter declared extend character vowel declared extend letter questions yeah yes thats great question question 270 relationship primitive type care actually come talk later class reasons im going right java actually primitive type called object wrapper object class holds value type inch theres called capital integer character car decide pronounce cant remember car capital character ill tease known boxing types come talk later class need relationship car good way questions thats higher okay like said object java parent doesnt matter youre think dont want parent sprung head god dont need parent doesnt matter dont declare extend class java extend object class declarations equivalent declare explicitly extend object extend alternative theres class java sound parent class capital o object okay try clear possible talking objects javas class system im talking capital o object object capital object parent class java java class parent parents parent parents parent long relationships complicated mature projects intellij example think written java said wouldnt looked intellij source code find classes lots lots lots parents object start class java classes parent classes parent classes parent repeating process dont find class parent object design choice java languages dont feature languages allow establish trees arent rooted place java rooted object okay results decision remember time times ago started talking sorry time talked inheritance ways started conversation posing mystery java classes methods didnt declare provide implementation like string java object string method takes arguments returns string method declared capital o object theres small number methods java remember exactly like 10 maybe 10 30 men certainly like string theres like hundreds theres small number methods declared capital o object class result single java object methods thats kind cool right wonder useful methods useful talk sec object java long know son variable long know doesnt contain primitive type strength work right heres example dog class dog class declared extend object implicitly extends object string method ill minute string method doesnt actually particularly useful customize behavior helpful okay organizing principles gonna gonna rest semester common object methods okay theyre gonna organize little bit journey rest javas class type system okay ones want care youre welcome look java doc capital object look java doc declarations methods java object inherits object superclass ones care right called strength string returns string implies idea high string object return kind human readable representation object main place string okay debugging typically use code user going need write example imagine youre trying know area mode display screen right dont string know need lot work right turn useful graphical representation youre like lets youre debugging youre trying print object want know stuff strings super helpful implement correctly okay thats methods care maybe equals okay interesting theres notion java object equality objects turns create class java decide means instances class implementing method okay object equality method compare object finally theres called hash code probably makes sense right come later incredibly use tarts start building interesting data structures use store work different types java objects okay think returns int idea int supposed represent like kind combine hash hash breakfast good try like hashes know bunch stuff combined chopped ill throw place thats kind half tho supposed supposed objects contents reduce int supposed change objects contents change change dont come partner okay wonder know useful object methods find object useful know think let lets look look dog looks like dog okay dog slides yeah better okay dog right know string method find parents object class object string method going able print useful dog probably thing want print print dog piece state right helpful debugging bunch dogs figure know theres bug code caused trying operation particular instance dog dog breaking code know pretty helpful maybe named axel oh got set null like okay typically use methods defined object superclass theyre helpful dont know class instead youll called override mean overriding method means replacing method inherited parent parents parent ancestors implementation okay im dog class dog ive decided useful debugging print instead dog class going string method matter override im harriton parent capital object didnt extend want method string method useful ride returned dog print object going print okay let stop pause brief introduction know method object java figure use heres starts gonna start dog class gonna look method called string method arguments match type signature thats note compiler run time helpful compiler catch errors form case compiler finds method called string takes arguments thats gets doesnt find goes looks object finds looks parent class finds method uses doesnt find method theres failure occurs know slide said looking variable method modify start class came variable method right signature argument use look parent class remember parent class define private methods wont cant inherit private method look parents class public protected methods cant use private methods private basically continue process find thing im looking object object im good object doesnt thought compiler fails error message right lets play little bit okay ive created arbitrary convoluted class structure ive got animal class thats parent extends object ill know doesnt matter usually youll extend object explicitly dont need right animal extends object pet expands animal dog extends pet old dog extends dog sweet old dog stands old dog super sub class called itchy old dog sort days right im creating sweet old dog object instance class sweet old dog lets happens strength string method defined sweet old dog know mad czech style okay happened lets talk process java went looked method started said okay im instance class called sweet old dog sweet old dog provide method called string takes arguments look sweet old dog doesnt provide method whats class look ya old dog sweden dogs parent old dog provide oh look dog look look animal look object dont override strength dont provide implementation method object provides okay wonder okay combining pieces information object knows class theres sign theres like random thing looks know changes time run want wild guess yeah yeah think hash code object actually think words stored memory useful like trying debug program useful okay instead lets override string method im going provide public method called string okay lets return sweet old dog gonna better minute okay happened sweet old dog started looking found string method right away lets send lets imagine pet im gonna lets lets lets met lets imagine lets street sweet old dog lets provide constructor sets lets return okay thing gonna happen im gonna pilar error constructor constructor gone provided new provide provide debugging create sweet old dog lets print pull okay lets try little bit different lets old dog thats sweet chu chu lets balu old dog whos pretty sweet okay whats gonna happen okay ive moved level sweet old dog gonna run oh yeah doesnt constructor takes lets rid im seeing default object string method thats printing type old dog memory lets lets experiment resolution works lets add method okay string lets animal whats gonna happen right ive added string method like useful slightly maybe slightly useful string method object gonna default string method pet use dog use old dog use run know animal oh okay problem whats problem yeah yeah need public works let think know lets pause important understand works java compiler choochoos start looking string method choochoo start sweet old dog class overrides string okay thats method got method declared line 14 start looking string method old dog dont defined sweet old dog im sweet old dogs parent old dog doesnt override string pet dog doesnt override string pet doesnt override string animal thats wrong variety different rays example lets public string string lets argument return thing im looking method match type signature exactly im looking method called strain takes arguments looking method called string takes changed movie argument itll print print talk questions yeah ah question use guys seen annotation override code places think intellij courage use yeah thinking talk today dont want talk annotations reason exists help check sure youre actually overriding method right overrides youre overriding method compiler wait hold told supposed method supposed override didnt override right good thing avoid problems like right whoops look know like yeah essentially debugging technique mandatory yeah mean im overriding method right dont okay lets talk tricks use start able establish utilize inheritance relationships java class talked constructors said class frequently wants setup created im creating want think create lets previous slide create sweet old dog im creating old dog dog pet animal object actually possible old dog needs work set possible dog needs work sell question start sweet old dog im gonna run sweet old dog constructor want run dog constructor place use called super know sounds awesome right theres magic powers unfortunately doesnt like immediately cause credit mp instead calls parents construe super constructor thing thing youre setting new instance object super set parent child additional work child finish job okay lets example heres example right ive got pet pet pet type type dog cat ferret rabbit hamster snake lizard lion know pets bad idea yeah type thats feet thats thats property pet know subclass pet inherits dog create dog know kind pet dog thing dog constructor pauls superclass constructor pet class thats super start running constructor thing ill called super calls constructor right looks constructor parent takes single string argument constructor sets type pet class dog inheriting dog constructor common pattern super thing thats called thing allow parent class needs initialize things need finish initialize class typically involves example initializing certain fields class parent doesnt pet different breeds dog added breed property parent dog type dog breed vary create dog need provide breed called superclass started create pet finish grading pet object set breed passed yeah yeah great question question happens im multiple okay happens multiple parents happens multiple parents java dont multiple parents job yeah java class pair right talking ancestors yeah okay yeah want sure clear yeah languages multiple parents class creates lot problems java decided ignore mess class parent ancestors okay super run constructor parent possible parent parents constructor thing super parent set parent thing co super run way point theres class need setup super alright thats things work alright thats minute dont think add constructors super things flowing way yeah lets sweet old dog constructor called super starts running old dog constructed lets super starts running dog constructor lets super writing pipe constructor theyre gonna finish finally sweet old dogs gonna finish yeah sense yeah good question right lets sure works works fine chuji type lets print choochoo dot breed oh public sake example okay good right questions right right break let try blow minds little bit cool jams type system enables utilize feature called polymorphism polymorphism thats funny theres funny definition cool tie theory lot practical applications going time practice comfortable patient ok know particularly came background moments know class actually gets hard couple days good right hope everybody right definition polymorphism idea provision single interface entities different types polymorphism literally implies single java object behave like java objects depending context im right essentially sort hinted beginning class polymorphism allows work entire class java objects share similar features ok gonna_talk different types java polymorphism going talk interfaces couple weeks interfaces incredibly cool let identify different types java polymorphism going think continue think comes sort naturally weve talking inheritance called subtype polymorphous okay poly morphus morph change poly multiple implies java object actually kind behave like object java object work typically actually behave like kinds java objects class youd created case thats dog right second object depending inheritance relationships youve created okay dog extends pet pass dog function expects pet work pass dog function extend expected object work capabilities use determined type object consider dog im saying im thinking confusing okay gonna sense minute okay heres thing think pet object extends object pet considered pet considered object extends dog actually treated different types objects treated dog thats created treated pet pretend pet pretend morph object pet extends object ancestors morph dog essentially sneak function expects object behave like object function stops dog essentially disguise object purposes running particular function okay heres works okay heres example know mystify little bit code work okay lets whats going example class want draw attention method declared line 14 called print static void return public argument takes havent seen theres know particularly special takes single argument called print whats type argument big o object parent java ancestor calls string method variable prints result okay places youre looking sense weve seen theres new feature language thats emerging example main method im creating different types object ive created little object hierarchy right patent dog extends pet pet obviously extends object implicitly created dog line 9 created pet line 10 whats weird seen thats normal create objects im good im comfortable im seen whats wrong code mean showed asked identify error quiz know talking class looks wrong didnt understand relationships wrong coat doesnt sense yeah yeah okay agree little confusing print thats declared thats actually okay compilers gonna figure youre right track theres print okay whats wrong coat yeah okay pet doesnt define twostring method whats going happen pet doesnt override string string implementation gonna object thats okay thats theres sense tell yeah yeah print remember java looks function looks type signature whats type argument im supposed pass print passing line 11 kind object thats dog passing line 12 okay normally okay heres thing remember said slide ago dog morph object extends object pet pet morph object extends dog sorry extends object directly sorry weird okay heres whats happening thats called upcoming ancestors itll automatically dont special print print running dog object sounds terrible right dogs objects cat pet object right work run code theyll exactly weve class code runs heres thing thats weird okay theres pointed weird thing pass dog function expects object pass pet function extends object thats sorry little bit headscratcher function runs clear objects know kind object right string dog object line 11 string method defined dog dont defined object string pet didnt override string got default object limitation clear java forgotten kind objects actually right right like come ok weve talked right casting im gonna leave time come review polymorphism actually think instance leave come review time let finish connecting quickly nice piece computer science theory exciting actually happens theres called list cough substitutability principle list substitution principle substitutability idea computer science says theres desirable property s subtype t object t replaced s violating know altering desirable properties t okay actually deep principle computer programming languages list list barbara liskov turing award winner professor mit incredibly important work programming languages principle named whats turing award heard turing award ok nobel prize computer science nobel prize computer science instead award named alan turing people incredibly important seminal work computer science early theres award given year know right know won turing award year year people look people work review try appreciate wont sense lot actually lot people win award things affect world technology experience day ok ill come time ive little little slower thought today fine ok quick announcements guys getting ok ones important feel discussions core staff feel like important remind cheating policies class ok submit mp going automatically checked everybody submitted ok expect struggle class know frustrated point semester thats ok frustration goes work cant let push point youre willing wrong cheating policy website let easy ok heres simple rule talking human language problem fine dont want discourage sitting office hours chatting youre solving problem people thats ok know oh thing ok fine start exchanging source code way sing somebody write poem hand piece paper right send snapchat message group chat smoke signals wrong catch right mind work mp1 dont want chilling effect want guys help collaborate start seeing know people sending little bits source code passed willing accept right enjoy talk frustration monday enjoy weekend good luck finish mp1 monday class
music right okay today going continue discussion optimus weve introduced polymorphism couple classes concept difficult understand difficult kind work practice thought today actually little bit material sequence gonna try normally talked friday im gonna try talking today friday gonna gonna come gonna_talk polymorphism new concept vocabulary think hypothesis actually help understand polymorphism works thats incredibly important understand objects actually work java powerful concept computer science place notion reference gonna thats kind plan couple classes today going talk object references knowm little bit related able right object oriented concepts couple weeks conceptual know challenges class going know increase continue talk different ways working objects particularly people havent seen objectoriented programming understand tough stuff fact seen objectoriented programming havent seen things gonna_talk youve seen havent seen explain didnt necessarily sense time today gonna references incredibly cool theyve time havent grappled mean implications programming objects java friday talk polymorphous examples think talk references polymorphism little bit sense idea ill repeat friday mean im gonna come today particular type java object actually references different types talked object morphs kinds objects doesnt sense like morphine weezer word im hide truth happens job particular type object youre allowed use reference variables refer object type super types know ancestor classes object java refer object reference ok need tell references thats subject todays class lets start couple times recently motivating example place isnt working way think ive set class called person pretty common instead writing centers getters public know write setters getters decided know little shorter ive got string method prints overrode string remember thats normally inherit parent class object didnt explicitly extend class example code im things lets look block code lets walk actually behaves pretty expect create variables primitive types variables store java primitive types theyre lowercase intz got comfortable familiar working class okay heres im maybe dull bear minute create int variable called set 0 created invariable called second eye miss value changed value second eighth okay print variables expect zero changed value ive initialized second zero value sent second expect hold zero second hold tape okay thats hypothesis whats going happen lets try apply logic java objects okay line 19 create new person object initialized required constructor provided line 20 im analogous line 14 set example intentionally lot parallel structure examples try trick essentially thats behaving way expect gonna launch new observation new understanding java actually works powerful idea set new person variable called initialize new keyword great okay looks lot like line 13 line 20 looks lot like line 14 create new person variable called initialize im making look lot like initialized second value initializing value far good line 21 set dot student okay ive changed ive changed analogous way set value second aitt ive set value u dot public string field private written setters getters didnt im lazy changed student follow example expect happen line 22 ive overridden 2 string print objects directly cant java object ill default object string isnt good nice look ive got ive got created jeff set u equal changed student expect happen think gonna print jeff student okay like example lets run happens okay huh weird places happened didnt expect happened violating intuition intuition developed worked javas primitive types okay weird going like lets try lets try changing u dot okay huh like whats happening change im making line 21 affecting dot affecting person variable fact lets print dot explicit thing okay somethings different lets try figure know glitch matrix lets try figure whats going introduce idea reference references super powerful place computer science lot use day day basis lot names things website names handles discourse references ok reference reverence value allows program indirectly refer right particular datum know grammatically correct wikipedia definition variables value record computers memory storage device right reference said refer data case dadums objects ok reference refers object accessing object requires dereferencing reference following term ill use following reference okay variables weve weve havent precise whats happening weve working objects java weve things like know line 14 ive created whats actually happening lets walk use new syntax talk whats going line 6 whats actually happening im creating variable called thats going store reference java object variable store reference person friday store reference inherits person ok im thing line 12 im actually providing initializer right come talk little bit null wonder null value reference lack reference set reference variable refer right trying access reference variable thats cost problem use dot notation youre youre following reference try follow reference goes end land pain nullpointerexception actually thing create reference variable java dont initialize value initialize explicitly create weve syntax guys getting comfortable homework problems starting today want precise whats happening line 14 whats happening right im creating new person constructor gonna run new object going created actually gets returned reference person object save variable variable compiler check store variable type person answer yes initialized store person references im good okay reference variables heres heres critical piece gonna diagram stuff like dont panic gonna lot sense actually lot sense happens line 15 critical piece puzzle going allow explain happened previous playground fly assignment java objects create new object things im going remind later class good know little tip dealing system remember objects java created new line 15 objects created piece code new line 14 references reference variables excuse reference variables called called store reference person object line 14 created person object saved reference variable line 15 create new object copies reference variable references object theres object system theres new objects new ive called new ive new keyword im constructor point reference variables store value thats actually remember things told know things didnt lot sense time going sense dont compare java objects double equals variables store java objects dont compare double equals hopefully sense use double equals reference variable youre actually comparing references objects line 16 u actually equal references refer underlying object okay change line 17 im creating second object im going reassign variable u store reference person object im gonna reassign refer new person ive got person objects ive got reference variables point refers person object created line 14 u refers second person object created line 17 compare reference variables double equals comparison operator java thats going print false right theyre longer reference okay lets okay note promised works let lets example try understand whats going ive got diagrams coming know references hear know names references heard languages theres sort like pointers c c theyre thing think pretty similar python references javascript ive suffered pretty language know modern language idea work similarly okay lets half figure happened hey created person object jeff line 19 line 20 initialized second reference variable called stores reference type person copied reference point refer object change meas going change change going change references object hey work differently lets create second person ive got person objects different references change u dot im changing object created line 20 object im creating object im changing object created line 19 copy references object change questions let let reference equality thing guys ill print u equal thats true refer object change u person know questions suspect gonna tough work little bit yeah question thats okay lets example lets set heres question question way change object question theres object right theres yeah theres person okay heres happen lets try im gonna fully explain okay let let whats happening line 19 create person reference variable left called initialize refer new person object jeff line 20 create variable called stores reference person initialize store reference new person object point objects new new set u equal okay work lets happens thats gonna work fine okay heres problem happens want person person line 20 created happened want change lets start right yeah idea person yeah gonna gonna use gonna use analogies references minute mind come right dont reference java object anymore overwrite reference line 20 executed reference new person created line 21 wrote reference copy reference created person created jump theres reference person anymore dont reference java object exist fact talk know point future want know understand java little better dont reference java object actually stop existing point java smart realize line 22 person created longer needed refer change print dont reference itll away job actually care automatically right lets lets lets gonna help lot actually references places actually good realworld analogs let example phone number remember references thing refer references allow refer theyre thing refer heres example phone number refers phone ive got phone number write number reference phone use phone number phone create 10 references write phone number 10 times people dont 10 phones pretty cool actually dont solve phone phone number reference phone thing thats referred giving number phone imagine theres phone world knows number phone exist philosophy 101 deep existential question right phone exist right like lose right stop existing knows probably phone number phone phone number isnt useful right know point somebody literally number gonna good receiving calls guys things phones find phone useful actually point number able refer purposes bina phone im able receive calls exist thing references makes powerful control reference lets continue phone example lets stopped paying phone bill alright whats phone company going number phone number controls dereferencing process occurs guys phone number pick phone dial number theres complicated process goes phone company looks number database tries figure phone identifier forward eventually happens fraction second phone starts ringing lets stopped paying phone bill phone company couple months know theyve called sent bunch angry emails point going youre gonna number whats gonna happen going work anymore phone company controls reference controlled process dereferencing number stop paying bill theyre gonna gonna stop number going work anymore calls phones going ring instead whats going happen theyre gonna message like number longer service heres example reference good street address right similar phone right lets talk lets talk references work change things right example let class okay lets guys like example lets reason im sort fugue state couple guys home address planning lets goes throws eggs house okay house eggs person comes gonna house eggs house 10 references uses reference change house changes visible everybody reference lets look playground example quickly right lets lets original version point ive got java references references java object person holds reference change visible holders reference use change use change doesnt matter work frustrated student eggs house got egg right second frustrated student eggs house got egg right doesnt matter reference gets okay right think ah yeah like yeah theres sorts things refer person weve tried set reference systems social security numbers campus id university id number thats reference lots copies number im making copies reference refers controlled university point know university ok person student anymore im gonna university id im going destroy im gonna somebody probably dont theyre probably right questions physical analogue right oh sorry ah good okay good question question copy object java lets actually want copy object copy reference right let lets review reinforce fact copying object copying reference copy object person copy phone number copies phone copy street address copies house youre copying reference youre copying underlying object right okay said things know heres example copy reference line person option right lets actually walk whats happening promise diagrams okay lets actually walk kind visual depiction whats going right variable stores reference im gonna depict arrow coming pointing object refers right ive created initially store reference value use refer java okay ill come reiterate friday slide use dot notation youre actually following reference thats null try string null pointer exception right person person reference null lets try string guy youre gonna oh mad okay lets initialize fool compiler kind dumb actually yeah null pointer exception okay great point cant person set refer new person object new keyword created object right visual depiction object dont want guys addicted kind diagrams theres know horses largely rely type visual aids help understand stuff heres problem develop internal mental models figuring know particularly sort basic things know software development company places cuttingedge computer science dont type diagram place people internalized point work having draw lot pictures takes practice guys heres place im going draw picture okay person reference variable reference refers new person created age zero thats default initial value int right created new person ive got constructor class set zero default remember thats look defaults java documentation right okay things gotten complicated important picture understand ive created second reference variable called refers object reference variables set store reference person sat reference returned created person object ive copied reference matters end point reference know know theyre different places slide cant store reference change oh diagram break oh didnt like okay hold sec let let quickly need need diagram okay yeah mistake trying change right class dumb let okay semester example number different okay right second reference change age heres im im reference set age person theres person system okay hopefully little clear going change change instead set age okay change set age person object system created online change visible okay works expected questions right know thing start keeping mind start working references theres separation variable doesnt store object variable stores reference object allows changes know methods change public instance variables changes visible reference object right questions whats ah let come answer minute yeah question like need references object yeah ill come ill come minute right actually know let im gonna slides okay good right ill come end ah heres heres reasons function method java method parameter argument thats thats object im actually passing method object reference fact im passing copy reference use method right heres example line 11 ive created person initial age 39 function called birthday function takes person argument increments persons age returns new age code going operate person object created line 11 times new code person object thats created example line 11 sorry line 12 birthday happens birthdays initial argument set set copy reference variable meat thats passed argument means function change object pass case modifying persons age heres example essentially birthday running references person object thats birthday function second thats held caller function place essentially references good question allows functions java modify objects past right changes object inside function changes visible caller function work better let slides yeah heres diagram version create person age 38 birthday birthday running code called birthday reference person called birthday reference set refer person birthday makes change person change visible caller method yeah place good question right let let bring thing im gonna end create array java objects whats actually array like variables java store reference object object arrays objects store references objects objects playground mess let whats happening heres things little tricky new whats actually created person array references person objects ive created array called people able store references person objects think default initial value inside array theyre java create objects thats responsibility gonna right okay line 11 examples know ponder class asked forum understand works understand references work job line 11 im creating second array thats going store references person objects second array called people going store store references person objects loop 8 10 im calling new new im creating persons ages starting 0 starting 18 sr 18 19 20 21 loop runs 4 times line 11 array people references actual java person objects created inside loop inside loop different new im creating person objects instead im im copying references people people know like fun thing fingers thats good diagram know imagine array right array filled references person objects second array references objects arrays storing references java person objects ive created java person objects java person created initially stored place people array copy people array ive got copies reference im going array increase everybodys age im going second array print everybodys age youre gonna going people insane people actually references objects okay lets lets lets happens im removing modification removed modification lines 18 20 youll people stores references people objects initially saved people array people people people works identically reason arrays store references objects likewise modifications people people arrays store references option youll everybodys age increased 10 years fly questions example gonna toss right end class chew little bit work know working javas objects actually great computer scientist learning internalize systems think effective draw pictures youre getting started start work building mental models stuff works right reminder theres little cheat sheet oh wait sorry object copy yeah thats actually great place finish asked copy java objects answer builtin way java think obvious like object actually object content object nice way java turns reason objects state dont want copied object okay want actually copy java objects options object provides thing called clone doesnt actually think thats actually good option implement called copy constructor line 6 8 im showing example copy constructor person class work takes person takes reference person object constructor starts capital person class doesnt return type constructor constructor takes argument reference object type copy want class case person use copy constructor return person age let oh lets quickly heres second person object lets actually way copy person object constructor person person reference right different persons lets sure thats true im going set age second person object 18 youll reflected right sorry reflected sorry ive got print sure dont reference right reference age instance change object provided copy constructor nice thing copy constructor control gets copied code write want leave fields field know shouldnt copied copy object alright option gives control thing thats common actually things actually intellij generate boilerplate code super exciting think theres know option intellij says know generate method generate copy constructor okay let summarize talked today couple couple points new theres new object thats creating objects created java new keyword period exceptions hide inside function inside loop create java object use new type comes new actual type java object important polymorphism friday variables store objects java actually store references objects copy theyre copying references youre copying objects okay right oh need need throw quickly need todays homework problem little bits java keyword bingo semester final modifier add class add final class means class extended class final extend class okay little bit esoterica need todays homework problem right important announcement guys getting talking caa captains weve decided wednesday night office hours friday office hours today 500 office hours starting week fridays 5 8 ok hopefully agreeable know feel like thats gonna better job meeting need office hours today 1 2 3 enjoy beautiful day guys friday office hours 1200 500 500
hi jeff channel today class gonna special guest visiting wanted help track week guys continue homework problems means decided record screencast look interfaces specifically vases fermented java little bit review monday youre welcome skip ahead unfortunately lecture mic didnt work dont video post im gonna pick kind minutes left end lecture introduced interfaces concept going introduce idea working interfaces java interface means java programming language concept interface talked cs 125 important pervade computer science computer systems interfaces place interface implies place computer system computer program things come boundary things boundary different parts computer system example youd interfaces pieces software library youre piece code interfaces software hardware plug new device computer thing said install called device driver essentially software runs computer understands talk hardware youve connected interface thats provided machine new widget youve decided hook interfaces computers users computer know computer humancomputer interfaces things like keyboard thats input device thats interface place know literally case computer come contact youre touching computer screen example interface place theres boundary data exchanged pixels rendered computer entering eyeballs boundary machine know permutations different components humans hardware know software hardware things like interfaces know general concept pervade design computer systems computer applications way thats incredibly powerful know things thats important interfaces place things come connect touch interact thats place need specific careful design communication components think software libraries welldesigned software library interface thats easy people use makes know eager happy integrate project best case know use software library guys check point gcl library google theres sorts code google wrote somebody google wrote dont need understand code works implement interface google provides need read documentation understand particular method thats package library work interact rest program ill define interface know allows different parts system define need know system need know system system need know system agree agree communication interaction interface going work lot happens system completely hidden thats good thing right allows big software development projects work things like microsoft windows chrome know code powers amazons services huge projects worked tens thousands people main ways happens coming decisions different parts system touch interact interfaces interfaces going work teams work independently things fit work theyre integrated end incredibly important idea let quickly examples kind set stage sorts examples software interfaces separate pieces software interfaces explicit like use library api application programmer interface thats interface thats designed application programmer use interfaces usually documented theres lot know java doc surrounds interfaces figure use work interface implicit example test cases write mp checkpoint homework problems establish interface code test suite interface involves agreement decide function different test suites going work interface test suite code youre going write function specific takes specific set arguments violate interface test code wont able work thats example interface thats implicit sorry explicit implicit know theres lots software hardware interfaces kind fun fun places think cool things happen right know teach class theres chromecast stuck theres actually bunch different interface going theres interface chromecast projector theres interface thats thats hardware hardware interface theres theres software runs chromecast helps manage plug chromecast connect laptop theres interface thats established laptop chromecast data sent actually wifi theres software runs laptop chromecast makes possible lot sort fun know new software catches hardware catches use examples creating interesting interfaces things normally wouldnt normally wouldnt able project screen directly projector screen face projector needs thats different interface chromecast allows things brought know mentioned theres lots different computer user interfaces pretty way interact computer touchscreen keyboard pops phone peripherals examples computer user interfaces humancomputer interfaces interesting know area study increased development right mean thinking interfaces better thinking theyll look like future weve keyboards long time theres theres lot points people said oh people going stop keyboards everybodys gonna talking computer gesturing computer read mind think know things future computer keyboards turned remarkably resilient input device okay going focus class specifically software interfaces course specifically interface context java programming language want clear interfaces idea thats tied java idea thats specific language certain computer languages example java example lets example theres theres bunch right actually include specific notion faces language specification computer languages interface means specific java exactly interface means interface actually keyword language like class like extends right means specific languages dont specific notion interface like python javascript interface exists right place pieces software come interact communicate interface interface declare like interface java interface dont youre language doesnt specific idea integral interfaces language languages choose formalize dont interfaces exist programming language use perfect final note know gonna slides exactly interface means java java class possibly use class thats public visible programmer interface interface doesnt implement specific java interface interface java class essentially set methods provides use set public methods class provides know lets block java blank string pull documentation latest documentation ok java 10 mean lang string implement interface right essentially interface string consists different functions ive mentioned interface place im actually right interface place need good documentation value interface allows use understanding works means write use right example trim trim method right returns string value string lending leading trailing whitespace removed tells doesnt arguments tells returns new store interface essentially interface documentation english human language dont theres code trim theres code lowercase description need interface code string class implements lowercase designed interface read code know exists dont need know works need read documentation need convert string lowercase theres method help okay java docs basically bet doc interface documentation right lets look example interface java like said java interface keyboard look little snippet code thing probably reminds class declaration talked classes allowed open javas type system create new types new types java objects makes different types state behavior interface level starts know beginning looks sort similar right ive got public interface instead class ive got interface looks like class follow conventions interface names class names theyre capitalized okay ive got open block okay kind look like right sort looks like beginnings method declaration right ive got return type ive got method add ive got list parameters ive got parameter int named second parameter named second ive got cold sorry semi right theres body method right ways java interfaces look like objects contents method signatures implementation interface interface know tell got called ad saying essentially function exists called ad learn things function looking know interface declaration know theres function takes arguments second returns end thats know theres code clearly interface doesnt theres code implement ad sort providing information know right interfaces declare methods variables gonna focus methods class interface variables essentially useful declaring constants variable associate interface essentially public static final dont hold know dont think useful think interfaces declaring variables way thats analogous object class declares variables theyre useful pointer console alright clearly interface providing information know clearly theres code run declaration function order reason declare interfaces classes implement yeah declared interface declare class implements interface heres ad interface line close function called ad says know function takes arguments returns int class called adder looking familiar public class adders im declaring new type implements act little similar extend right saw extends meant extending class going inherit behavior potentially ads things implement interface java commit use implements keyword implement methods interface clickers interface declares method declares called add takes arguments order implement add adder class actually provide implementation add kind makes sense implements keyword makes sense im saying im gonna interface actually work right told function called add arguments im actually going define ad works im going implement ab class providing implementation function public ad takes arguments returns expect right alright interfaces dont declare dont useful essentially kind provide declaration certain capability thats right class add tags right declare want interface use implements key right lets play little bit lets look code know pretty weve looking loaded playground ive got public interface ad declaring method called add takes arguments public class called blur okay im actually lets thats door reference lets ad equal new matters im creating new matter im gonna try calling add function run know clearly right havent implemented add going pop lets declare outer class going implement ad interface run need different error ive told compiler hey plan implementing interface know need implement plan compiler telling hey told going implement ad interface dont function anymore right lets elizabeth lets music okay need claire public right great function right great let point couple things dont implement ad order work right worked fine right implement ad way declaring im going provide particular capability example interfaces lets happens change interface lets know method whats going happen error got compiler complaining havent fully implemented ad interface interfaces multiple methods fact lot times alright lot times heres case add methods want fully interface okay great notice know dont follow dont use parameter names interface uses thats know interface set type signatures methods need declare essentially says need implement method called add takes integer arguments okay lets ahead minute come look example talk interface references object class implements interface talked know weve specific difference reference variable type object type talked fact reference variable store reference object type descendants object extends type reference variable reference variables store reference class implements interface reference variable type interface type compiler check sure class im holding reference im trying set reference implements interface thats whats going line 12 okay im left im saying im creating reference variable called lowercase ad reference going store reference implements ad interface okay thats im telling compiler right im creating object called adder thats im going use try initialize value reference adder implements ad works fine interface reference remember talked job object cast capital o object reference cant methods defined object methods defined capital object like string know things like thing true interface lets look example adder implements ad ad interface says order implement implement function called act doesnt multiply refer object implements add longer multiply object use initialize reference implement multiply right lets lets concrete playground okay lets lets okay lets couple examples lets look case implements heres im line 11 class called adder im implementing ending interfaces im providing public method called add takes parameters returns sum im implementing add create im right creating instance class adder im saving reference variable store instance app hat add reference variable stories reference adder add implements add function okay lets okay works actually sorry lets lets yeah lets okay lets try changing add variable interface reference says want use add refer implements add interface youre going compiler error try compile code door converted add adder doesnt implement interface add implements add works fine lets lets try second class implement add provide case know heres heres lesson interfaces dont way determine class implemented interface important correctly interface knows youre providing function called add takes integer arguments returns integer know youre actually adding good documentation comes handy right interface says arguments class isnt sake messing lets okay heres add equal new slow carefully line 17 im saying im declaring variable called lowercase ad thats going store reference object implements ad interface initialize store reference adder object line 18 change reference store reference object implements variable store reference implements ad interface didnt implement ad compiler error line 18 lines fine door implements add line okay yeah lets half lets public voice pulse know lets beam function latex style gonna angry lets boy like boy ive got sort function cant important note alright ad interface interface includes method called add class thing couldnt lets try alice cant reference implements interface methods implemented elements lets right problem needs implement right dots actually interface thats case thats prove confusing okay good know fulness interface refer reference interface type thats essentially takeaway okay ways want point relationship inheritance right ways pretty similar inherent overloading right interface sort like parent plants implements sort like extends providing invitation sort like overriding parents method kind like extending superclass extending class implementing overriding method provided class turns heres heres example thats right know im similar add public class implements add im casting reference adder object add extends add want override method right okay know behavior ways similar example walked actually pull buzzword know keyword bingo cards abstract class possible similar abstract methods okay dont want dwell want talk interfaces kind want im trying im trying draw whats special interfaces think class inheritance model know heres example public abstract class called add instruments abstract method declare abstract method cant provide implementation try ordinal today right youre gonna complaining abstract methods body body youll extend add compiler actually fail says implement app actually provide implementation add abstract great youll okay example use extension parent class actually provided default implementation overrode use abstract actually case parent doesnt provide default publication problem know theres actually requirement provide add override know nonsensical result right cant implement know gonna compiler error add abstract method meaning extend class provide implementation okay wait okay need interfaces like actually gotten similar behavior know wanted talked combination extension inheritance abstract classes methods interfaces okay heres problem jonathans inheritance model limited class parent theres means essentially know think children inherent capabilities means want certain want know certain classes able certain things entire tree able soon capability character digit letter consonant able thing right dont want want know things little bit flexible big differences inherit inheritance interfaces java classes implement multiple interfaces super important heres example ive got interfaces ad interface subtract interface madi class matthew class declares implements interfaces declare interfaces want declare implement multiple interfaces implement methods declared interfaces declare implement implement ad know implement ad method takes integer arguments returns integer diplomat subtract time implement method called subtract takes integers big difference inheritance interfaces java class implement multiple interfaces extend multiple classes heres example know wanted add tier subtract method im going failure implement ill code love second okay thats interfaces java lets lets step minute gonna spend lot time todays screencast friday talking interfaces work thats new new concept think pretty everybody took class matter prior experience interfaces arent dont think gets covered ap courses particularly whats important interfaces know regardless interview theyre implemented regardless actually theyre language like job like javascript interface represents contract parts program parts system idea interface know codifies things parts need know order things work correctly okay interface im showing going use lot days homework problems quiz weekend places okay actually real java interface lets pull java doc obviously stuff like okay heres actually real interface interface implemented lot classes know definition right im showing simplified version pretty okay okay mean interface called comparable method called compare method returns int takes object reference object returns okay heres place know ad interface looked sort sort clear supposed happen function called add takes integer arguments didnt java doc probably guess supposed clear know gave right wouldnt sure heres interface supposed comparable interface class implement instances class okay means theres meaningful order exists objects class talk continue deeper comparable kind interesting concept compareto comparable class compared theres meaningful instances class java parts java compare instances class implement function function called compare compare takes reference object returns following negative integer zero positive object equal greater specified object object return negative negative equal return zero greater object greater specified object return positive okay lets actually wrong right returns negative negative number zero positive object equal greater specified pumpkin okay comparison object specified object water good example nervous reason java object compared meaningful way java instances class cant ones ones like objects inherit object comparable arent comparable objects extend object isnt comparable want establish comparison relationship think trait like capability classes java dont class capability declare implement comparable implement function class compare instances object okay okay cool right interfaces awesome powerful live compare lets create new class java okay project youre working realize okay actually know actually sort theres order think theres meaningful order instances class right example youre working machine project wanted order games maybe meaningful order buy time like game start right order games games started earlier time come games started games look time stands like start tell started earlier started great later okay thats example theres code java following sudden array objects class sort dont know didnt need know class instances order thats know sort right find maximum minimum value thats example right arrange instances class data structure called binary tree going come talk couple weeks know interfaces source powerful thing essentially setting new interface class parts java theres sorts parts java use interface implementing useful things dont write code dont know works code doesnt know class thing know class compare instances class crystal clear comparable instance represents abstraction barrier implement comparable dont worry sorting function going use implementation instances class order dont worry binary tree code works tell java tell world compare instances class similarly use comparable interface sockets implementer user use comparable dont need worry interfaces implemented know correctly compare objects long implement comparable okay tough understand slippery idea come talk friday trying wedge firmly brain possible right isnt example computer science notits abstraction barrier point agreement weve agreed implement comparable implement function weve agreed function works thats need agree point code implement comparable code uses ability compare instances superclass goes way theres communication coordination thats required code bases great thing okay gonna close today example fun okay turns thing lets turns theres lot code java implements comparable let example im gonna create java primitive type theres called wrapper type wrapper type object stores value primitive type int rapid type called capital integer im gonna im going create array integers okay im going need kind cast lets drop laying drink comparative silence oh know im rid happens yeah okay think gonna work yeah cuz im oh okay china style relaxer okay great sorry let okay let definition im gonna comment problem comparable interface want use javas right great im close cool alright lets look example interface function called maxima alright come gonna_talk friday function takes array values compared example casting interface time know values stored array values compare right thats critical maximum function work okay maximum function return object going turn maximum array need know order finish order values lets implement actually okay lets need value null values length equal zero case kind corner cases values array null doesnt content doesnt actually contain return contains value maximum value okay heres im going guys implemented im going im going start saying maximum value im going rest array loop gets missing loops coming im gonna need check able print value greater maximum lets look compare know compare function comparable values right comparables yes use got zero maximum says going return positive integer number greater specified object values greater zero maximum equal values reference maximum value im going return okay cool im integers okay find maximum implements comparable actually neat lets try strings new string string like comparable okay lets rid integer im going strings oh mad lets checks paul want whats okay maximum array strings compute maximum implements comparable right like powerful piece code ive written works java object implements comparable object lets lets actually implement compare instance class right instance value class okay actually dont want lets try happens lets couple possible value im gonna initial know story ends alright compiler complaining says value converted comparable reason value implement comparable ive created new class havent shown java compare instances lets implement comparable interface gonna tell need implement method prepare lets return 0 ok oh ive gotta fits ok essentially point basically saying oh lets add string method sure nicer public string oh theres cute little trick use im im basically saying values equal maximum value array going value theres bigger right thats probably want need little bit work thing kind like equals thing reference object actually dont thats actually want need reference values check like equals im gonna im gonna oh im saying thing passed actually return refer value im going alright theres actually better way handle best thing right im gonna create value reference im gonna downcast object reference value reference know ive check instanton instance value ive returned create reference reference downcast object reference safely lets lets return value minus value gonna work value bigger value going return positive number smaller going return negative number going return zero thats pretty corresponds know interface think backwards lets try lets try like lets got okay yeah think backwards gets interface positive integer object greater specified object right value value bigger return positive object im actually im im actually flipped right sorting smallest saying smaller value greater value im saying greater value smaller thats kind fun actually thats sort wanted try right class charge deciding want compare classes heres example im im returning im saying value greater value value bigger swap defining comparison ive got opposite returning smallville know cool thing know consumer interface provider right class provides implements comparable interface piece code comparable interface compare different batteries bunch classes implement comparable actually know like actually find maximum value sorts different heights know raise sorts different types objects thing need implement comparable interface okay couple homework problems come continue conversation friday know kind thing going talk objects week monday going class begin talking data structures algorithms objects know difficult think conceptual bit object class incredibly useful know wrap mind concept means implement interface difference interface provider interface user prepared understand different types computer systems work right ill guys class today class friday good luck homework
right come everybody today gonna continue discussion algorithms algorithm analysis class fun far use skills abilities weve built knowledge imperative programming object programming cool things thats kind gonna rest semester learn new things way add objectoriented concepts techniques bag tricks learn recursion new problemsolving technique havent talked know lot gonna think algorithms analyze data structures build analyze right analyze data structures analyze algorithms reminder time earlier semester know think important understand algorithm set steps use solve problem algorithms need know form write know need able describe solve problem way use solve problem implement algorithm actual computer code algorithm code algorithm implemented variety different ways youll algorithms written called pseudocode pseudocode actual real code theres compiler computer program run pseudocode specific somebody implement java kotlin python ruby rust okay computer scientists know going utilize computer capabilities implement algorithms going perform simple computations stuff talked like couple weeks class weve slowed little bit object section gonna thinking performance circumpacific calculation variables store results know repeating things making simple decisions building blocks algorithms gonna_talk data structures know algorithms sort connect class data structures connect second class right finding new ways structure data looked arrays talked arrays data structure far today going start talking generalization arrays use build cool data structure loader little bit java practice analyzing algorithms programmers java programmers want structure data new ways things bag tricks extend javas builtin classes create new kinds data classes weve practicing right thats theyre right things theyre create new data structures going utilize capability know need store things actual arrays data structure java gives todays homework problem friday going talk use array building block build general data structure acts like array features arrays dont like ability extend know adding items end beginning ability add items middle things programmed python languages builtin support youve gotten job arrays dont build data structure acts like python list java array data structure going store data internally array going provide interface allows behave like list thats whats kind neat right look second array implicit implementation lists like great way start project right build new arrays data structure know build utilizing object thats gonna use bootstrap discussion trees right thats way establish structure data objects instances class store references creating structure pieces data right topics highly complementary class going interweave possible know today friday building data structure new data structure called list gonna analyze operations list algorithms long add item list long items list long add item end list things like gonna analyze like theyre algorithms going util plantago themes utilize specific features data structures right lot times know recursive algorithms talked gonna implement trees trees lend type algorithm style program know dont use data structures arbitrarily use data structures achieve result typically theres algorithm want implement implement weve chose destructor data little bit different know talk trees going talk tree data structures talk cool algorithms use build know theres deep relationship topics exist vacuum theyre intertwined okay way plenty chance practice imperative programming techniques learned class objectoriented stuff weve learning recently right review monday talk algorithms important things usually want understand perform heres thing know guys born world filled algorithms know look sort data wikipedia page youre gonna find list like 30 40 different sorting algorithms different sets steps solve problem different tradeoffs thats trick want sort implement bogo sort know bogo sort okay view sorting fanatics sense implement fogo sort program slow guys figure bogos sort hopefully little chuckle implement bogo sort work eventually sort data good fact extremely bad series steps accomplish result sophisticated computer scientist look list think little bit properties specific data youre trying sort choose different algorithm boboso doesnt perform sorting algorithms better okay ability think implement okay know hacker implement algorithm computer scientist think algorithm analyze think happens different types inputs think work different scenarios good good solve problem type choices matter right know type choice line determine job job place startup makes big know guys dont dont remember right people remember social network facebook yeah youre embarrassed age dont raise hand theres right know contrary popular belief facebook social network wasnt remember facebooks contemporaries old old people myspace oh yeah whoo seen myspace think myspace actually like covert project terrible web pages ugly web pages place know kill yeah myspace myspace actually didnt try offer features paper yeah like yeah okay ill trying similar facebook identify friends stuff like theres actually friendster remember friendster friend store account day yeah pre facebook social network know things doomed friendster mean friendster worked kind like got peoples profiles kind like early version facebook mean newsfeed evolved died pretty quickly know problems friendster facebook didnt initially related talking user perspective yeah slow yeah slow page like load understanding got worked friendster hopefully hopefully worked friendster notice flame ill find happened right understanding friendster actually trying maintain social graph real time anytime example rules like people removed somebody allowed profile imagine people guys probably facebook right youre like oh goes tangent going change slides minutes im gonna check newsfeed right imagine graph changing time friendster constantly able answer questions somebody elses profile doomed think perspective user site slow think trying solve hard problem facebook didnt initially facebook got eventually early versions facebook siloed specific schools certain permissions allowed pretty went like college little went user model worked facebook help ground stuff matters start startup core business model solving unsolvable problem far dont clever way okay talk algorithms typically going focus refer behavior limit happens problem gets big category come theres couple reasons um know reasons thats things interesting right problem gets big thats things slow problem start answer questions like know given certain inputs general cases algorithm gonna perform whats bestcase scenario algorithm whats worstcase scenario number thing trying figure whats relationship algorithms performance problem trying solve okay example im sorting things expect relationship things sort long algorithm takes sure im searching lets im search bunch items expect relationship number items search long takes find item figure item doesnt exist right things going try notation use things categories lot going gentle simple introduction algorithm analysis guys 173 way 225 line 374 classes important concept teach gentle introduction notation use referred big o notation okay essentially putting things categories defined relationship size problem long algorithm takes solve gonna today gonna categories talk certain problems property look features actual java code hint youre dealing problem type categories shown graphically matters right o n refer linear time means problem gets bigger algorithm gets slower gets slower linearly problem gets bigger twice items look search algorithm takes twice long right thats thats green line oh little friend helping wonder like zap laser actually probably powerful right lets look different gonna look today owens square polynomial time exponent means problem gets twice big algorithm takes times long problem takes gets times bigger algorithm takes times long okay bad lets look farther n exponential time size problem longer exponential exponent okay problem gets bigger solution slowing faster right compare polynomial time exponential time way left factorial time awful algorithms mentioned earlier bogos sword actually runs factorial time good good algorithm use know theres categories particularly ones logarithm theyre going huge sense talk recursion okay typically typically occur certain features problem half big searching phonebook example know famous demo david malan cs50 year phonebook im looking number open middle number im looking half second half phonebook ive problem half big essentially half numbers look repeat process matter big problem stage half big im gonna whats called log end time log n times pretty good barely barely growing problem size gets bigger thats actually nice nice way heard example david like oh hes ripping phone book half thought ripping half like hard way know like crossed spine like wow working knew graduate school hes ripping like spine thats easy right thought itd fun example like chainsaw actually like know cut cut apart algorithm doesnt work right complexity classes lets start meeting okay dont actually graph cant hidden axis oh thing want point time n appear big o notation youll oc know idea algorithms depend size input time know goodmans like right imagine number balls pick random takes constant time describe dont look pick random called constant time common think looking think sorting think know algorithms weve talked like designing route united states try minimize travel time dont run constant time algorithms run consequence know operations kinds operations java constant time heres example accessing element array java takes constant time reasons important understand like positon thats useful building block algorithms loop constant time inside assured loop know inner loop takes time time execute think complexity loop inside ok right lets talk things start interesting o n known linear time problem grows linearly time takes solve problem goes linearly size problem remember big o analysis actually figuring n depending problem thing frequently figure n right thing problem measuring connecting long solution going imagine problem size n algorithm needs pine thats proportional size input features youre gonna lot particularly code look loop right array size n need element array oh end thats o n step right essentially heres array case size 1024 imagine im going im computing sum right set sum 0 concert time array loop im going value array im adding good question aside example onl girl know heres way think guys come algorithm sum elements array reading element array definitely prize waiting right lot cases o n best look value cant compute like wanted sum ages cant compute asking age estimate know sample area multiply size room thats im solving different problem right want know exactly sum ages ask age cant know getting everybody question difference perspective ants enhanced forloop regular loop algorithm elses yeah question know replace regular loop index loop maybe change algorithm complexity right tough got yeah right need group elements think searching alright lets want search room find somebody birthday maybe theres room thats birthday turns actually probability birthdays hot like hot known birthday actually sorry dont know misstated probability birthday like 100 probability birthday lower talk known birthday paradox wanted look room find birthday possible everybody lets dont find come room ive worked entire floor birthday balcony birthday look talk find birthday im im curious birthday 915 thirteens claims people saying yes confused somebodys birthday talk later want sure id right theres like lot search problems away particularly dont data organized way data organized better okay heres seeing pretty big difference complexities heres oh constant times right okay lets lets look common essentially search algorithm okay ive got value called looking birthday im going array find looking im gonna break okay lets apply algorithm analysis principles problem frequently helpful think best case worst case okay maybe average case right whats worst case lets start worst case scenario okay yeah yeah yeah essentially worst case scenario array contain element okay worst case scenario case hit break statement wont exit loop ive looked single value array okay okay whats bestcase scenario yeah position yeah bingo okay position iteration okay okay gets tricky average case performance algorithm wants start conversation easy think average case performance yeah okay square root n okay thats interesting explain answer sounded cool yeah wanna dont know need know answer question yeah distribution numbers array okay let easier know value looking array dont know know average case performance im gonna find element element whats average case performance yeah right beginning times way end guarantee element array average case n okay element array array array positive numbers looking negative whats average case runtime win right time looking way thing dont know prevents solving right best case element worst case element average case think slide wrong depends distribution elements right know looking array oh n talk thing want point talk complexity analysis typically ignore multiplicative factors 2n 2 4 8 n theyre n doesnt matter throw know work google boss hey found algorithm makes search times faster youre going ray right dont like oh owen cares right know million times slower owen like cares right people care talk categories algorithms growth gonna factors okay know relevant real world absolutely right gonna worry okay lets oh n squared problem gets times bigger solution runs times slower problem gets twice big decision runs times heres hint youre looking o n squared problem nested loops right triple e nested loops ive oh n cubed wrote rupa blessed o n fourth right heres example okay example terrible algorithm remember said talked time know algorithms bad algorithm moves problem faster complexity class slower complexity class good algorithm opposite bad algorithm ill talk minute start looking figure okay im taking actually read figure right called sorted returns boolean takes array integers input nice look imperative code right kind fun loops loop goes array second loop goes array starts okay actually going element know doesnt big difference essentially im looking im looking pairs elements im looking case element larger index element smaller index start j j goes array dot length j equal bigger ah start j plus 1 okay essentially im saying found pair elements j bigger better ray j smaller im gonna return false entire array dont find elements im gonna return true checking array sorted right thats way good way alright case loop compare cases frequently end nested loops ends oh n square know ignoring constant factors isnt exactly oh n squared time execute n second time 3 x minus 1_minus 2 minus 3 know n squared 2 n outer loop n 2 average inner loop cares gonna ignore constant factor oh n square right identify frequently nested loops 2 loops theyre theyre nested dont mean oh square like oh wet owens step o n stuff add dont multiply right lets analyze little algorithm whats bestcase scenario thinking inputs im thinking im asking input causes algorithm perform tell kind kind cases theres actually infinite number inputs algorithm perform itll basically steps alright yeah remember gonna normalize size array answer super small array yeah small array small performance small im saying n right actually true size array right theres feature array thats gonna cause algorithm perform way array n elements need look change elements array cause algorithm ok elements yeah yeah look ive got escape hatch return statement inner loop conditional trick algorithm head path okay lets think know okay time come 0 j 0 array raj going point im going conditional time ok started plus 1 started right right j array j array theyre value time array inner loop j 1 0 second element array smaller element ill return false time rest doesnt execute remember little review functions work soon hit return statement im bail home run array billion elements 1 second 0 finished found needs find looking sorted ascending order elements second mls clearly doesnt matter happens rest array ive found counter example array sort okay best case unsorted pair right beginning case algorithm steps worst case algorithm thats kind interesting yeah yeah sorted right imagine sorted ascending order whats gonna happen im going loop return statement excuse ill condition okay wont return means dropped outer loop means actually inner loop time theres break way escape conditional starts line right worst case array sorted actually interesting example type algorithm algorithm tries find array sorted finding counterexample array sorted going return true returns true certain cases youre like lets lets program need check sure array sorted youre pretty sure sorted like testing code run makes sure array sorted render list elements user verification step takes o n squared time run think data sorted lets cut great great property okay dont know element unsorted beginning end average case performance algorithm o n squared okay essentially pair elements looking o n squared algorithm worse things start bad know start worry performance particularly problem gets big cases ran local machine gave array pointed small arrays good yeah test cases arrays size 12 ones write test im good im running production array million elements know coworkers like dude servers youre like running sorting algorithm right problem minutes itll come im sure notice right pointed im going talk growth rates come logarithmic feature making problem dividing problem half right essentially way think algorithm problem half small stop usually oh log n oh log time right theyre recursive algorithms start implement trees frequently okay let come know trying relevant spend minutes talking know remember dumb algorithm makes simple problem harder okay test wrote array sorted dumb oh end problem okay wished past sort special like slide background use bad code use right reproduce algorithm wrong faster way find array sorted dumb algorithm taken o n problem o n square hand smart algorithms problem solve know maybe brute force solution certainly like gcd right gcd algorithm o euclids method o log n weve taken problem straightforward solution know ran linear time actually sorry oh n squared right actually o n log n makes difference right sorting algorithm sorted method took problem belonged moved euclids method took algorithm started moved okay know introduction computer science find fun moment right want sure guys dont exit class sense deep interesting unsolved problems computer science people heard problem okay okay way refer problem know p p problem thats hear people talk p versus np p equal np going talk length problem hardness difficult algorithmic difficult essentially theres world dont know okay dont know theres specific category problems weve identified lots problems fall category turns theyre related interesting right right theres specific category problems world harder problem know okay problems category called np non polynomial time slow solve p pretty problem think weve managed find polynomial time algorithm right lets right polynomial time algorithm polynomial time algorithm n squared n fourth 12th doesnt map okay non polynomial stuff left right things grow faster polynomial know dont know im ill curious lifetime somebody prove time developed little bit confidence able find pie mealtime algorithm solve certain problems thing thats interesting remember said theres like group problems similar thats theres group problems solve youll solve right im going group theres group similar problems solution use create solution managed find polynomial time algorithm solve problems okay problems arent group found polynomial time algorithms happened maybe years remember kind big announcement problem thought np somebody came polynomial time algorithm remember problem super relevant online security sorts interesting things remember problem guys alive happened long factorization given number figuring factors right actually testing prime think problem called prime given number testing prime think problem np turns found polynomial time algorithm polynomial time algorithm found doesnt lot turns slower best non polynomial time algorithms use randomness attack problem way thats cool right heres example heres thing thats interesting category problems non polynomial problems dont theyre hard easy verify solution sudoku good example sudoku turns example problem whats called heart npcomplete sudoku puzzle ask verify ive solved correctly polynomial time theres things true able verify solution quickly coming solution different turns small grids sudoku actually pretty easy makes big sudoku puzzles hard extremely quick right im actually gonna know minutes right total change topic quickly need talk order talk container data structures apologize like total train wreck transition right okay remember primitive types like primitive types int long stuff like turn annoying point life java object objects methods like hashcode equals want able use methods want able work things like integers longs stuff like java provides called wrapper types okay heres example looks like creating object takes integer literal okay single super exciting slide ready single permit type wrapper type wrapper types objects start capital letter usually shares similar primitive type wrap primitive types java wrapper types mean gonna start okay talk lists okay yeah super exciting okay im glad got right im gonna quickly partly guys need todays homework right couple homeworks guys going going start build great chance talk data structure design algorithm tradeoffs called list right list generalization array like array list puts items order okay features similar array example set values list like set values array use set function dont use bracket notation list provides function t like said generalization array new features want add remove values list middle okay lists probably useful data structures meet computer scientists refer data structures meet heaven lists maps end semester lists going talk okay gonna implement different types lists class couple lessons homework problems okay reason great chance tradeoffs different ways implementing interface use word interface right lists provide interface allows behave theyre implemented differently lists example okay gonna look example list built array gonna build called linked list uses object references store structure list right java lists real thing implemented java gonna guys work simplified version list interface im providing right okay interface list start working today homework continue working week going implement gonna point different implementations interface gonna called simple arraylist ones called simple linked list reason jabez list interface bunch stuff dont care okay set work way expect similar array bracket notation add new actually increases size list remove decreases size list size method alright pick friday office hours today clear room quickly today class midterm guys
right hi welcome gloomy late october day today lists guys arent youre gonna continue struggle homework problems today im gonna quickly review linked list insertion algorithm going start talking new data structure trees going consume couple weeks trees incredibly powerful useful data structure trees gonna open new programming technique new problemsolving technique thats called recursion gonna practice trees guys experience recursion want think problemsolving technique recursive programs going implementing recursive algorithms particular approach solving problems proceeds making problem smaller smaller solving simple instances problem weve small combining results kind characteristics recursive al right lets start quickly looking linked list insertion algorithm went quickly kind table based comparison linked lists array lists talked little bit tradeoffs remember implementations provide interface user writing program use linked list arraylist interface program doesnt change performance program change implementations different tradeoffs terms operations actually performance underlying operations lets talk insert linked list know guys follow youre working homework problem insertion okay problem need find right place list linked list stores structure internally need walk list similar reference following forloop looked time place access reference needs change doesnt turn index new item turns item thats item want insert find right spot going essentially set going change references tricky right youre gonna mistakes homework great practice things guys 225 222 41 courses later general working data structures computer scientist alright look trees gonna lot reference manipulation essentially need kind insert new link chain way remember chain references item item find want stick item list need items item change reference need sure rest list follows new item im inserting need sure rest list item rest list item list im item im inserting okay steps right im thats need alright lets look diagram quickly lets want insert value 7 wanted sort new item value 7 index 1 im item item item 5 item item 8 thats way think new item 7 item 5 reference item 7 item 7 reference item 8 im thats want okay thing noted actually requires walking list item 8 im gonna new item thats item thats currently index 1 need change preceding reference actually need walk list item 5 item index 0 makes little sense right stick item beginning list reference actually needs change start right essentially im walking list element index negative doesnt sense thats start reference thats start reference list implementation holds internally case im gonna walk list leg item havent reference access item need manipulate okay steps new item seven thing set item know need item item need sure rest list item item item seven youre careful perform steps stuck point think oh things going dont reference rest list anymore right thats little bit tricky hard mean know small pieces lying pieces code thats subtle right time times itll lot sense right sure reference item 8 youre gonna need read sure relink rest list new item nightma 3 questions abstract thats kind point know guys common know concern hear classes oh hard time translating ideas code thats like yeah know happens hard time translating ideas code right things youre like oh thatll easy year later youre working thats thats thats gonna away better practice okay case algorithm little bit know subtle walk couple times use whiteboard kind draw whats happening references dont understand algorithm youre going implement properly understand algorithm hard problem yeah whats set reference item instance variable thats reference night changed reference set refer item like know item item dot equal reference item seven item seven dot naxx equal reference item e yeah questions okay want briefly point weve talking thats referred singly linked list reason linked list reason item single link item thats minimum order establish order items imagine item didnt reference wouldnt list items bunch items wouldnt know order okay minimum need link right need able walk list item item following reference add reference item previous item okay thats known doubly linked list model item knows item list knows previous item list allows couple nice things thing allows allows traverse list order start end backwards start forward certain cases references middle list allows find start find end right kind list end looking like right youll simple doubly linked list class holds references shows reference start reference end start end walk backwards start started start walk forwards end start item walk direction find end list find start list remember talking little bit pointed linked lists performance characterization different operations linked list different arraylist thats implementations different tradeoffs doubly linked list store reference end allow nice yeah add end list long going 1 remember singly linked list add beginning oh cool useful thats actually good feature lists guys youre gonna_talk know youre gonna gonna like oh stacks queues stacks queues lists dont features right queue list cant modify middle modify ends stack queue modify end add remove items end stack essentially stack queue watereddown versions lists reason theyre useful removing extra features actually gain lot performance imagine list implementation didnt worry sticking things middle mean lot faster right worry sticking things middle cant access middle queue whats beginning whats end theres certain algorithms works great need access interior list better performance way w linked list store end add things end constant time add things beginning constant time dont allow access interior list theres operation takes index beginning end operations constant time pretty cool right thing want point look runtime tradeoffs different operations lists theres know love know happens dont know happens like class okay theres tradeoff arraylist linked lists thats tradeoff time space implement data structures weve algorithms think memory consume know bytes internally computers memory going required store information youll doubly linked list class youll item store references item serves references store reference value im actually storing linked list cant store data data structure hold reference item list previous item means reference stick list remember point data structures store data reference data stick list need references metadata right essentially need previous reference piece data right lick lists faster certain operations contain space space arraylist internally array array stores exactly right number references list theres wasted space arraylist array bigger needs youre wasting space array exactly right size way guys admit implementing wasted space arraylist reference data dont need references metadata im array help link list singly linked list need extra reference doubly linked list need extra references im trading space versus time implementation consume memory store data certain operations particularly adding removing viable doubly linked list faster okay arraylist needs n know store n intz n references need store n references linked list know n doubly linked list reference reference previous value reference okay good lets know goodbye lists lets finish table know interesting parts list interface ive got add insert im distinguishing putting things sorting actually insert insert remove right insert remove set fundamental list operations arraylist stick runtime implementation guys finished looked class stick item new item arraylist whats runtime yeah n yeah oh n size list remember mean chair analogy ive got stick somebody chair everybody row thats n steps linked list add essentially guys remember ad twofront looked like gets worse link list add able add look like yeah fast linked list winner perform insertions list extremely fast removals element remove arraylist im gonna repack array time right id set right remember set arraylist translated directly array index operation constant time right linked list whats problem lets want item thats middle list change reference oldest walk list general steps going beginning itll end overall o operation ive got walk list average owen owen know throwing constant factors okay insert arraylist general case insert arraylist similar special case inserting heres interesting caveat need start able insert items linked list badly arraylist special case adding adding end constant im linked list implementation wonder like know like arraylist kind winner right linked lists oh n getting set general case oh n general case add remove arraylist win getting set turns theres lot algorithms need access end list algorithms extremely link list dont care use know essentially calling queue stack list cant access interior dont operations right imagine operations board set add remove linked list looking lot better okay questions look guys essentially know work guys went read implementation lists python javascript guys sense tradeoffs let let throw caveats fun know order know big o analysis ignoring like sorts interesting things okay computer processor incredibly complicated beast gonna start mess analysis certain cases example processors fast copying memory remember array copies stuff turns slow think creator c actually came gave talk couple years ago talking colleagues day apparently pointed according tests c array lists actually faster linked lists board processors fast copying memory theres thing learn cs 233 thats called memory locality means access piece memory fast access pieces work arraylist im copying arraylist im accessing chunks memory initially nearby actual computer memory guys chance think cool complications caveats downstream course right fun theres lot subtlety honest computers continue change evolve stuff revisit lot right fundamental underlying characteristics computer processors memory architecture memory hierarchy storage devices supply path play decisions implement algorithms right thats talk week thats know think sorting solved problem theres annual competition implement efficient sorting algorithms thats held year reason hardware keeps changing people coming ways okay questions lists goodbye lists class sally forth okay lets talk trees data start gonna look class called tree time youre gonna time youre gonna hear trees fact sick hearing trees trees incredibly widely data structure store sorts data implementing sorts different types algorithms start know comfortable right tree know essentially emulates hierarchical data structure honest feel like probably know sort realize recently mean kind looking trees wrong start sort like turn tree upside maybe youre looking roots right root node tree grows downward right lots pictures okay lets lets introduce terminology know intelligent conversations right tree tree consists set nodes linked references theres structure rules right parent refer node tree parent children nodes okay case heres parent node parent children way working construct tree parent going references children shoulder references nodes parent nodes okay heres heres important_role tree distinguishes graph general data structure tree child parent start node tree walk parent parent parent eventually node thats called root doesnt parent despite remind little bit object hierarchy java uses thats bad analogy java organize objects tree root node capital o object refer node thats tree node tree parent root lot algorithms gonna start root gonna work rest tree moving downward start root node examine children examine childrens children etc right ive got tree root node tree root node single node tree doesnt interesting tree single node tree like single item list root node child node children node children example tree children dont leaves tree finite number elements trees work start work way word eventually im gonna place find nodes dont children refer nodes leaves tree stops growing right tree arbitrary number leaves certainly cant leaves notes depends structure tree finite size tree start start work way word im gonna find leaf nodes right nodes leaf children notes leaf child nodes leaf child node dont children leads right talk level node tree enumerate referred depth numerate starting root depth node tree number steps takes starting root node ive got tree ive highlighted root node thats levels level depth zero children took step children depth children child taking steps child depth leaf node depth height tree height tree maximum number steps takes root leaf node height tree okay theres deeper theres deeper branch need okay questions terminology know think know think sort know turning things upside tree growing upwards kind bean like roots descending doesnt write tree grows downward right trees nice pretty particularly time year grow right questions yeah yeah question like whats difference tree linked list linked list item item tree node children great point eliminate node linked list fact node children makes tree okay general tree general general trees tree node child children wants lot trees look class going called binary trees node children zero children right create trees theyre useful guys work 25 arbit node arbitrary number children good question level generalization list usually dont think way thats kind good question questions trees talk little bit okay li let try motivate work gonna lot fun trees couple weeks particularly writing recursive algorithms run trees gonna know recursion concepts going hurt brain time learn gonna mental workout easy think easy work gonna lot practice im warning like remember remember years ago taking second semester programming class encountering recursion mean like boo boo know took long time wrap head happening trees going friend gonna book things use trees kind data storing like id hinted java class hierarchy represents tree node object java parent parent hey dont extend explicitly capital object extended determines node class attaches tree okay know fact extend class means tree extend multiple classes complicated true node parent node root java class hierarchy capital o object parent object javas type system class javas type system pair okay know guys sort like subliminally aware think data computer people aware like computer stores data like theres data thats like turn turn im teasing ive talking colleagues fact like world different grew know certainly forgive thinking stuff lives cloud actually bad model right actually kind operate way today turns theres actually data computer data stored chunks referred files files theyre organized hierarchically way theyre organized particularly linux unix like systems like max know laptop runs linux tree single root names files computer descend right thats place trees internet domain names right sort interesting heres place okay whats whats domain example domain internet guys use time probably dont know maybe maybe example yeah called toplevel domains gonna domain youre right track mean domain example dub dub dub com domain type browser bit website right dots separate different parts domain purposes organizing way control domain names tree right know person question point conde d u dot org called toplevel domains thats level tree names level level dubdubdub com dot google level www reason organize names tree represents controls theres organization controls dotcoms dot edu x dot funds new ones created right point google apply access com com music google com know like google ad right replace google apple facebook want names controlled google google doesnt talk anybody google wants april fools google com google gets choice thats controlled google right actually create levels s125 dot csilla noise edu dot edu controlled organization point illinois applied got access use elinor wait university illinois campus cs dot c s domain names controlled cs department want like years ago hall talked works building hey cs 125 dad siesta illinois daddy like yeah sure right know structure represents domain names managed know find lot data world sort hierarchical structure right hierarchical structure java allows inherit determine class properties know computer allows files organize folders stuff like internet domain names represents control right dot edu illinois dot cs youre going know group people ive met control gets access don edu group people know firstname basis control dot cs right right extra pictures heres know example java class hierarchy heres looks like tree right heres files computer yeah point guys 225 126 guys maybe start poking youve seen interface computer called command line allows look files computer theyre actually isnt files computer snapshot theyre organized way end organized tree like said domain way domain names translated right cs 125 dot form dot cs domain names got talking somebody works yes department controls space want dot cs know talk little confusing domain names actually people design system said regretted theyre backwards right typed comm google dub dub dub okay right makes lot sense like right theyre reversed right general end lower leaf root end right data structure going work class known binary tree binary tree special case tree node children zero zero children children heres going represent tree data structure kind cool actually right tree class consists references instance variables node tree want able store data lot times work trees class gonna concerned primarily examining structure trees store data examining know example tree stores different domain names internet time time address browser need store information know domain names tree represents like linked list item class value reference value references like list references array references binary tree nice thing know im gonna 0 1 2 helpful right im gonna right left nodes gonna right child left child 9 represent having child reference know right child dont right child love child dont left child im leaf node dont child okay going work look graphically thats right left comes handy thatll refer parent node hanging right right child hangs right left left okay heres cool connection recursion algorithmic technique lets start observation look tree true lists want point trees subtree tree break tree tree okay matter break tree smaller pieces pieces end trees heres example lets look left subtree root root node value 1 left subtree subtree starts node value 3 okay single child child couple child like squint little bit look blue nodes thats tree different route route object root value 3 instead having lets 3 6 9 nodes 4 nodes tree okay look threes subtree look subtrees 3 theres 3 child tree small treat heres thing thats cool trees getting smaller going helpful start write corrosive algorithms win having tree 9 nodes im looking tree didnt note 3 nodes single node tree ive reduced problem tree truth node 8 tree okay node start exactly thing tree thats subtree tree rooted node thats rooted node tree consider completely separately tree note tree root seven tree heres tree heres tree descend tree started problem know nodes needed think node tree reduced series problems thinking tree node tree definition tree class recursion actual definition recursion guys going come guys gonna start think veron dont want think narrowly recursion recursion broad set ideas problem solving techniques recursion function calls thats implementation possible implementation recursive algorithm know recursion algorithm recursion describe data structure recursion occurs defined terms look tree class tree class thing true lists didnt stop point tree class says tree consists value references trees right recursive data structure order define continue try define alright defined terms references definition thats true right think ill way node node going represented java use class node going tree object value going refer object like integer tree reference tree thats left subtree reference tree right sort hopefully things connected clear workers definition know recursion algorithmic technique way decomposing problems big problem break smaller pieces solution big problem depends solution smaller pieces find problems small solution doesnt depend smaller pieces reconstruct solution larger problem probably little sense lets examples far let let distinguish weve weve things ways weve approached problems referred iterative okay looked iterative solutions class guys youre linked list right youre walking thats iterative approach walk list theres recursive way item list dont teach dont think useful think better way list use iterative loop great chance practice references trees hand great fit recursion okay iteration im repeating steps im recursive solution im breaking problem smaller smaller pieces find small solve easily okay lets talk counting basic things probably want able tree determine nodes tree want count number nodes tree right approaching problem iteratively need find way visit node tree lets reference node root node value write loop goes nodes tree counter inside loop incremented time im guys implement size length list youre going right basically know heres trick trees heres want warn point maybe classes weve practice recursion try write loop okay easy impossible use data structures stuff like natural going nice think certainly gonna look nice length list loop wrote ones nice reason item linked list item ive got cases ive got items handle yeah like said point come yeah ill ill leave exercise melissa come try approach problem recursively okay trick recursive algorithm problem smaller problem thats small easy solve try figure combine results problems right heres im going approach county come implement friday want break problem smaller pieces okay general pattern recursive algorithms break problem smaller pieces continue find small problem cant avoid solving combine results way thats appropriate problem im trying solve alright heres im gonna gave tree gave reference tree rooted node 5 know problem smaller heres im gonna consider left subtree 5 right subtree 5 smaller problem time lets look know count tree heres know count left subtree count right subtree knew nodes left subtree knew nodes right subtree know nodes tree right left right plus okay essentially im saying dont know solve problem know solve problem counting left subtree solve problem counting right subtree able solve problem okay heres start left subtree pretend subtree world oh know count left subtree dont right subtree count left subtree know nodes tree number left subtree plus plus 1 write trees start start algorithm pretend tree world tree thats rooted node 7 ok need problem smaller problem smaller met problem small solve node children nodes tree rooted node 7 1 know know answer right finally found problem thats small know answer okay remember im going subtree im gonna okay figure count left subtree 10 right subtree 10 know nodes tree rooted 10 left subtree plus right subtree plus 1 im leaf node know nodes tree node 1 im leaf node know notes tree start combine results remember 3 said hey count left subtree know nodes tree ted said hey count left subtree right subtree cuz add im starting integrate results bring problem broke til easy im combining results know nodes left subtree node know nodes right subtree node started beginning node said count nodes left subtree nodes right subtree know nodes tree point alright pick friday write code solve problem office hours today monday good luck midterm youre taking today know guys friday stay
today trees gonna problems tree recursion gonna gonna set challenges going occupy week sort classic problem computer science turns actually heart lot interesting systems building block lot important interesting algorithms thats sorting items order sorting fun thing talk easy thing understand conceptually goal sorting lots different sorting algorithms know prove think guys actually prove cs 173 maybe cs 370 worstcase performance sorting algorithm good new sorting algorithms developed bestcase performance average case performance kind air right know know best sorting better certain performance given allowed pick inputs practice new sorting algorithms developed fact default sorting algorithm java python think variety languages developed 20 years know think im 20 years old exciting thats actually know problem classic sorting thats actually pretty new owl okay right lets finish talking end class wednesday went recursive tree algorithm right recursive approach searching right goal return true item exists tree false remember heres sort recipe building recursive algorithms particularly recursive algorithms trees work types data structures actually today look couple recursive data structures actually build recursive algorithms right recipe identify base case problem small solve recursive tree search know essentially base case ive reached node descendants ive reached tree walked tree walked leaf node walked node didnt descendant know point treat contain node im looking tree contains note okay theres base case recursive stop im gonna consider left right subtree separately remember goals recursive step making problem smaller dont break problem smaller step whats happening im actually making progress solving right recursive algorithms solve problems breaking smaller pieces theyre small theyre easy solve recursive step isnt creating smaller problems im actually rehearsal algorithm going work right trees nice thing know given node right subtree left subtree represent smaller problems sub trees fewer nodes tree thats rooted node im okay alright recursive step look comedie way combined results interesting right idea im going use logical essentially value tree contain value node im starting im currently examining contains value left subtree right subtree right thats combine result right ill reproduce quickly practice usual going use private function public function gonna use private gonna essentially private function bootstrap search root node gonna return search root need private wrapper time im kind kind speed thats gonna value node im currently considering base case current null ive reached tree treat contain note current value equals value remember shortcircuit evaluation going work current node im examining contains value dont look happen contain value wont proceed branches statement shortcircuit evaluation java know statement true stop right contain value look left right subtree im gonna restart search current left need restart search current dot right right statement contains recursive step result combination pretty common cursive step fact im looking right left subtree combination results im logical value exists tree exists node exists left subtree right subtree right lets works chuck styles angry think fix earlier didnt dont know theres tab theres tab okay went wrong happened guesses sir theres bug clearly wrong yeah ah yeah use wrapper function careful im actually calling wrapper function whats happening right didnt plan making mistake know people mistakes including whats happening im calling wrapper function wrapper function calling tricky wrapper function calling search root node remember java distinguishes overload function versions search takes arguments object reference second node reference second function takes reference reference object reference search root root node right calling instead calling isnt error hope compilation error okay whats happening good review object references java compiler runs code clearly doesnt want whats happening yeah yeah im calling search im passing node assume compiler wait theres version search takes argument takes node reference whats happening automatically yeah yeah node like java cast safely object whats happening code compiled compiler saying okay lets find search function takes argument youre passing node okay dont dont takes argument function takes object safely cast node object thats whats happened need need actually pass value think things working okay lets try things lets try value sure false lets try sticking values tree true let try thats let try thats root sort thing class im thinking like write test cases guys homework problem okay let sure find thats leaf node let sure find thats root node let sure right thing tree okay heres thing saw right sort like little bit guys 225 youre going learn trees probably care trees entire interesting family data structures youll learn know weve looking binary trees theyre trees binary theyre red black trees binary search trees gonna look minute sorts different trees different tradeoffs different properties guys learn downstream let know left time said ok heres heres problem best case dont search entire tree thats kind nice right value root node search gonna going stop soon gets root node thats im looking current node happens root node contains values search calls search function root node says roots know says root dot value equals value im looking answer yes im right left subtree lets lets uh lets explicit lets fun lets lets search count lets public zero time start search function initialize search count zero time enter search ill set search count plus plus fact lets increase actually node lets search count plus plus im able print value search count variable okay conversation ladies hi im thanks right tree right clearly know theres work right lets nodes tree steps takes find things lets 1 2 3 5 7 8 ok run node looking root node lets look thats deeper tree okay took nodes tree 6 actually search entire tree found note looking thats going vary little bit building tree randomly im gonna look entire tree times 8 going end like subtree im gonna find quickly look run bunch times youll gonna 6 gonna 4 bounces little bit look lot tree find reason 8 leaf node steps azar gonna find tree right lets look like negative 1 going 6 going n n number nodes look entire tree cant certain doesnt contain value im looking right heres question efficient gonna actually going know answer way search efficient changing structure tree ok given type tree working theres organization things theres way search efficient think im looking tree tree structure items like like unordered list unordered array thing certain value actually talked sorting later class reasons sorting important building block algorithms sorting searching lot efficient arrays flat data structures like lists dealing tree question search efficient thing going involve things change structure tree need exploit structure search agra heres key observation right interesting place start runtime behavior falls complexity classes havent looked right key line line 61 youll line look places current node right subtree left subtree build binary tree way knew node right subtree left subtree dont search search essentially okay know node left subtree ill look whats going happen im going start search algorithm going directions im going know direction involves change structure tree right want know look search rules things added tree glorious moment confluence brings friend comparable remember worked little bit comparable interface promised ability things order powerful right gonna use sort stuff items order sorted list use build whats called binary search tree okay search tree ive changed binary search tree lets look differences little bit got node class youll notice node class little general store reference object starts reference object implements comparable search tree store items order implement compareto binary search tree cant tradeoff tree store type java object store ones theres meaningful notion comparison able things order contained tree right things know node class pretty similar okay constructor different essentially takes terrain adds item tree time public add method takes calls private add method add method recursive right essentially says try add node cant pick right left subtree heres difference okay added note tree picked right left randomly essentially said node choose right subtree left subtree current node try add new value subtree thats values end tree build trees list elements different trees im making random selection time im randomly anymore right structure youre right new value greater right current dot valued compared sorry equal right current dada valued compared click hall compared value tree comparable compares new value greater zero right left im im building tree based properties elements tree building algorithm build tree twice list elements identical trees rule things want careful build trees twice elements different order theyre added different order different trees ok order added matters build trees elements theyre added order identical binary search trees rule things questions right think instructive lets look guy add method right wish right add method line 27 im randomly choosing right subtree left subtree okay im im making choice based value node thats added questions right okay heres cool thing advantage search tree right heres idea didnt think recursive algorithm look contain value im right thats different thats cases right current node contains value return true whats different dont contain value know decide look right subtree left subtree know new value tree right essentially value greater look right subtree look left subtree vice versa doesnt matter right thing thats important search function constructor agree values example change code equal doesnt matter whats important add function search function agree rules putting items truth right lets try interface right search function lets ahead happened right okay thats new problem lets lets search problem thats fun problem right im gonna write wrapper wrappers gonna value current node okay lets return false lets search function search value root node im gonna sure oh return result couldnt sure dont mistake okay lets sure working right false supposed false okay lets lets reconstruct recursive algorithm current equal null return false know means found tree tree elements root ira cursed know leaf node tree okay mean simple concept trees contain right contain know im looking right want following essentially current dot value dot equals value im going return true colon needed value im gonna return true stain better choice look okay heres heres gonna gonna current doubt value dot compare value im gonna im gonna look add algorithm right says value current add value doc comparative value greater zero value going right subtree im gonna use piece code return search value current dot right returns search right dot left mixed stuff possible backwards lets test find okay notice look right left sub trees im relationship value current node value im looking forward decide look value look right subtree sure look lobster okay angry okay yeah okay looks like found value lets sure finding things shouldnt exist okay right found value found okay like working right far doesnt exciting right essentially ive reimplemented search algorithm right sense worked right want want look performance lets lets search count set search yeah search equal 0 incremental pretty little bit instrumentation gonna print okay thing im going isnt important im going change order nodes added tree ill come talk sec lets okay ive got little bit different tree right okay lets actually look thats tree right lets look negative okay cool right results correct right dont sound tree look look nodes right look look let value alright look right lets try find node thats deep tree like node okay return true steps big case takes right turned actually needed look nodes tree right built tree dumb way lets okay dont picture depends structure tree general number going n im gonna find things quicker right im gonna find things dont exist lot quicker right useful right time im going search thats tree im gonna going smaller number steps okay lets think little bit lets lets know algorithm analysis binary search shouldve pictures im prepared talk useful way lets lets think thing thing tree thats balanced number nodes looked looks like tree alright got bunch like nicely balanced fall tree okay im searching tree algorithm whats run time lets imagine youre looking value thats tree okay steps going normal search tree whats run time looking value doesnt exist tree tree n nodes run time good question search trees weve working far search tree looking node node isnt tree nodes visit yeah nodes place right dont know things ive got single node find convince okay heres challenge problem binary search tree nodes best case nodes look convince node isnt tricky yeah log ok interesting thats complexity classes havent thought thats correct let tell remember recursion making problem smaller okay thats exactly whats happening imagine tree n nodes start node look doesnt contain value value tree pick right left subtree look dont look step ive gone n nodes n 2 continue second step n 2 n 4 continue im gonna n 8 time im making problem half small repeat steps runtime log right talked complexity classes pointed log n n log n characteristic recursive algorithms log n result making problem smaller half small roughly tree tree set properly im making problem half small time ok think ive said better picture right lets lets let im gonna come time end recursive tree traversal lisp fun right questions thats fun example think got distracted cool binary search trees guys theyre theyre super useful things youll 225 youll spend fair time figuring preserve nice property log search turns build tree build binary search tree badly oncb havior instead log n okay point weve recursion trees trees nice fit recursion hopefully ill problem skipped end thats problem thats designed convince essentially convert tree list use iterative approach solving problem right trees lend recursion arent recursive data structure weve seen talked fact things makes trees nice recursion subtree tree tree essentially im node look right subtree left subtree separately restart algorithm sub trees behave identically theyre trees right theyre smaller trees theyre trees okay data structures fall category weve talked trees subtree tree tree theres couple data structures stick property like tear apart smaller pieces piece valid data story yeah array yeah remember raise array break half smaller right ive got smaller arrays theyre wraiths arrays recursive data structure wells worked couple weeks ago kind generalization array lists thing listen arrays think basically interchangeable right list break contiguous pieces lists think nice trees sub trees smaller break list half halves lists smaller original list ive problem smaller breaking ray half halves array smaller original ray actually recursion lists right didnt way said lets use lists guys practice working references iteration reference following right thats loop wrote walk list linked list write recursive algorithms linked list lets im search right lets want know count number nodes list right tree said number nodes tree 1 plus number nodes right subtree plus number nodes left subtree list simpler number nodes list plus number nodes list follows right 1 plus number nodes list continue process eventually write recursive sized algorithm right im item 6 item 6 like idea nodes list know size list 1 plus nodes list know count number nodes right add 1 number nodes list item 5 says thing like hey idea nodes list im kind hanging middle know number knows list 1 plus left item 8 says thing item 0 item 0 like wait know nodes list starts pointer reference ah reference theres list theres note list right essentially solve problem right 8 knows list notes list 5 knows notes list 6 hot notes list thats wanted know number nodes list ok know lists problem smaller break current node nodes similar right left subtree subtree right like having right subtree smallest sub problem list list single element imagine searching list know know list doesnt contain element list right thing arrays important understand actually technique gonna use gonna ask recursion lists think know try right itll work actually nice way compare approaches right going recursion rings important understand imagine array absorb fact contiguous array array lets looking value array break break left right sub arrays break left right sub array left right sub arrays continue array element trivial figure element array right look element equal element im looking build solution complete problem smaller subproblems way thats similar trees fact theres actually nice mapping think guys 225 trees arrays kind look look kind kind feel like organize nodes array tree im looking kind process recursing tree leaves building solutions larger problem combining solutions leaf nodes right raised like lists like trees problem smaller break array smaller arrays smaller subproblem array array single item right thats array thats easy search way easy count build problem sort combine results way okay right hopefully ive convinced general technique questions recursion yeah yeah question happens odd number elements know imagine negative wasnt seven start know basically start combining results right yeah yeah thats great question going implement recursive sorting algorithms race odd number good question questions recursion introduced topic zit recursion guys homework problems love think couple homework problems fantastic hope guys enjoy know came good time challenge guys little bit harder harder homework problem theyre super fun okay sorting going talk week sorting okay said sorting fun problem brings things weve worked variety different things interfaces algorithm analysis recursion sorting algorithms involve imperative programming little bit tricky brought time analysis gonna recursion feel like sorting solved problem thats interesting turns sorting building block lots important algorithms okay think data google facebook microsoft stored away lot way access data efficiently sorting way data thats sorted easy find things theres famous example old graduate student colleague david malin tearing phone book half think find phone book names werent sorted right like good luck weeks actually good question touched phonebook like real phonebook handful okay yeah know sort old thing like like come like know youd sitting home day youd hear massive thump like inch phonebook phone company bring im sure actually hand anymore point sorting data phonebook easier search maintaining sorted list phone numbers thats important building albums right maintaining dana sorted format makes easier work search perform types algorithms right okay searching way efficient data sorted story things like duplicate detection imagine ive got data set come bunch different places im trying find items sort items wound remove thats extraneous sorting thats present data people right like data sorted form helps understand right helps things like identify trends right bunch data stock market throw graph sorted time makes sense sort time able trends impact events gone financial markets important theres webpage theres ongoing yearly challenge called sort benchmark apparently years deadline passed 2019 theres active sorting competition thats run guys enter wanted kind cool different categories im going detail obviously essentially competition sorting massive amounts data right problem bdoubles lot big know companies work data theres bunch different categories cant remember means example minute like records sort minute think theres limits type computers use stuff like right theres sorts rules want enter youll let let look know records set like fairly recently 2016 looks like 2016 good year sorting records theyre running right people trying better stop mention jim gray talked sorting sort benchmark cop categories named jim gray jim gray turing award winner lot foundational work databases data processing sort tragic finish life vanished sea dont know probably time actually international effort locate bunch researchers crowdsource problem going lots lots lots satellite imagery looking boat sailed san francisco harbor day came left massive legacy field deterring right gazillion sorting algorithms thats things makes fun problem talk going talk started friday looking simple cases analysis called insertion sort guys selection sort lab approach week merge sort recursive sorting algorithm thatll bring couple things weve recently theres called heap sort theres called quicksort talk quicksort example sorting algorithm interesting behavior perform given certain data perform poorly given data sets quicksort example sorting algorithm sort pathological behavior certain cases right bubble sort guys look lab tims sort tim sort sorting algorithm named tim tim invented tim sort tim sort java python bunch programming libraries default sorting developed century 2002 kind cool developing better sorting algorithms people worked decades decades ok lets lay ground rules discussion sorting gonna_talk sorting race race random access performance ok algorithms look applied things like lists type ordered linearly ordered data structure ok general like constraints gonna sort things ascending order thats doesnt express view world convention use right gonna things order smallest largest course apply algorithm reverse want largest beginning going talk sorting integers problems ask sort comparables whats cool java interface system comparable sorted place items order sort look things class easy examples use integers right guys thinking integers okay analyze sorting algorithms going talk time complexity talk space complexity sorting albums deal large amounts data sorting album thats faster requires twice space computers memory appropriate particularly google youre like ive got 8 trillion records need sort sorting algorithm okay talk long sorting algorithms talk memory need run complete ok questions dont think im talked fair friday im sure time talk today god little bit early unusual know right questions sorting talk fair friday couple announcements today started working hope lot choose nice mp brings guys semester nice check point right final step office hours today 1 3
music right today conclude discussion sorting thats consumed past couple classes going review sort quickly end class monday going review merge short run time going finish looking algorithm interesting wellknown sorting algorithm fun implement fun talk interesting behavior good behavior certain cases poor behavior cases unlike merge sort sort like know predictable know steady predictable algorithm sorting space review minute quicksort work depending inputs work poorly right thatll little bit chance exercise know algorithm analysis muscles actually large input dependence think little bit sort canonical dif quarter cases cause quicksort perform poorly point kind sorting algorithms lay talk couple properties like sorting algorithms thatll okay lets start reviewing merge sort implemented merge sort time guys chance homework week little bit different context merge step work didnt extend actually provide recursive sorting function wanted think run time case know little bit trickier loop nested loops like theres actually function theres recursive algorithm need think know times recursive function going called heres example analysis array certain size im going pick thats size thats chosen course example work nicely lets think happens point reach base case actually start merging remember like recursive algorithms weve looked ones run trees thing recursive algorithm way keeps breaking problem smaller smaller pieces finally gets problem cant smaller case merge sort case tree typically tree single node case array thats array array value array value sorted merge step actually right took array size divide arrays size took arrays size divide arrays size took arrays size divided arrays size total weve_got arrays size gonna start things right merge takes arrays size merges pairs arrays size okay heres tricky thing remember merge oh size resulting array merges merges producing array items im merges o n n thats equivalent o n step n okay takes o n size original array right im lot merges theyre small ok arrays size sorted need merge okay second merge im working im taking solutions smaller problems combining solution bigger problem ive got rays size im going merge im going merge pairs arrays size merges n equivalent step n oh okay ive got oh n step final step arrays size merge array size thats clearly merge size o n n 8 step level algorithm takes o n question levels going idea array size weve taken array size n break half step number levels going arrays size 1 0 log n log base 2 n ok think log log know hard people think log inverse exponential right combine things way arrays size 1 thats true matter big array arrays size 2 4 8 16 32 64 eventually im double stop eventually n going bigger array started point im doubles way number doublings takes reach particular value n log n ive got log n steps step takes o n big merge size o n bunch smaller merges works oh n ive got log n levels level takes o n o log n logarithm base 2 questions mouse know kind tricky right binary search algorithm guys worked yesterday lab right case thats o log n algorithm right think right start recursive search algorithm keeps making array smaller smaller says dont know value array size n itll easier find look array size n array item point okay ive got able find worked way time level start array start having search array element search array elements sixteen im doubling way property problem doubling problem getting twice half half size produces login behavior log n search thing time n log n sorting n steps level tree right heres maybe way think know start arrays totally unsorted ive got rays sorted size 2 ive got rays sorted size ive got big array levels log n base okay questions merge sort runtime sense everybody ok important algorithm performs similarly theres variation ok lets think unfortunately dont implementation remember think know algorithm analysis true forever true class think algorithm performs want think know bad want think oh case going right bad okay time nice things merge sort doesnt care hey n log n best case average case n log n worst case n log n look implementation time reason theres step point merge sort actually know branching based data thats array know says dont know data sorted sorted array im gonna break raise half size break race thing single time right thats nice okay predictable worry badly heres concern merge sort sort motivates sorting algorithm merge sort actually needs lot space wish wish idea implementation time merge remember time merge create new array merge original arrays right create new array im merging items turns theres clever things reduce space sort needs general merge sort needs temporary array im taking ive got original arrays total size n need create new array size n work right values im pulling original rates okay algorithm running needs temporary essentially needs temporary array size n problem think youre trying merge like billions records trillions records thats right mean cant think data know google collected facebook amazon mean actually childs play compared think things like biological data like genome massive data right linear data know working mean definitely feasible sort trillions maybe number passed trillions records look sorting benchmark competition categories involves sorting massive data sets hard find space store data set youre saying run sorting algorithm need space double took know terabytes store data need terabytes sort id cases nonstarter right makes weakness virtual okay lets look final algorithm right merge sort quicksort sort examples lot recursive algorithms fall category technique refer divided incompetent okay divide conquer algorithm know sort know describes recursive algorithms weve writing idea hind divideandconquer figure problem smaller eventually solutions simple solved directly right says solutions subproblems combined solution original problem thats weve right hear lot computer science great problemsolving technique right big problem smaller smaller smaller eventually small problems easy solve okay heres quicksort going work right heres unsorted away away array unsorted array step heres folks tries problem smaller right little bit different way merge sort merge sort exploited fact merge arrays oh n time quicksort gonna going ive got big unsorted array know sort thing heres cut array pieces values smaller certain value values larger value okay sub arrays unsorted went having sorted array size having sorted arrays smaller okay maybe eventually end small sorted arrays right lets works practice value thats called pivot choosing pivot value turns turns big effect quick detroit performs right im gonna pick pivot im gonna im gonna divide array parts values smaller pivot values greater equal pivot want pivot dont care rest values end thats important right im sorting array step im dividing array values smaller pivot values larger pivot right lets pick pivot value right youve got fine look array think value thats bigger pivot im step quicksort heres array going look like im going modify array right turns actually exactly right spot values left smaller value right larger havent sorted array right sorted values sorted sorted ive created smaller problem solve alright im dividing conquering think smaller problems basically restart algorithm smaller arrays note step quick story think important point pivot value ends right spot right place array pivot value value ends right spot values end right spot pivot value guaranteed right place okay started array size sword ive got array size array size array size easy sorted array size dont know im gonna thing im gonna pick pivot value example im choosing value array pivot multiple ways pick pivot value performance quicksort dependent choose pivot value come talk minute simplicity sake im choosing time right im picking pivot value im going reorder array values smaller end left values larger equal end right rays sorted ive got smaller problems solve ive got array size array size sort im gonna continue process picked value sub array pivot sub array value turns im okay questions quicksort subtle ill happy stand example mean dont expect guys think quicksort takes little longer mergesort wrap brain reasons talking weve seen elements right little bit sack lets look single step partition think run time gonna think steps long know levels algorithm long level right essentially look ive got know levels lets happens step pick pivot value track position im dividing clever thing quicksort way dividing array goes value time essentially look value array value belong pivot pivot value belongs pivot im track big space values need store pivot right find value thats smaller pivot need area know value larger im gonna clever im gonna swap right im gonna value thats current pivot position im gonna swap smaller value allows smaller value end right spot right lets watch works okay look 5 greater 6 sorry 5 6 answer yes okay im gonna pivot space bigger okay look 7 7 7 greater 6 answer right current essentially im gonna im gonna swap seven guys minute promote theres slide okay dont space need store smaller values bigger seven isnt smaller better chance happens value okay smaller pivot value belong left pivot im gonna im gonna swap seven im going increase size area stores values smaller sex okay youll swapping seven moved array thats gonna store values smaller pivot value case okay im gonna right im looking smaller im gonna swap seven im going increase size area stores values smaller pivot going 1111 bigger dont look 8 8 bigger 6 8 stays look negative 1 negative 1 smaller 6 swap negative 1 7 increase size area stores values smaller fit okay im right ive pass array thing thats left pivot value right spot know right value end range im store values smaller pivot right place essentially im gonna swap negative 1 6 im ok like quick kind magical right alright youll ive got 6 right spot right 6 bigger left greater equal theres duplicates array left smaller okay questions ive implemented quicksort bunch times think kind exactly whats happened right right thats good lets try implement right going actually going implement quicksort today going going implement partition function fun right way ive set partition function takes input array start end position reason way guys implement homework youre gonna use start end target smaller parts array actually complete implementation recursive quicksort right essentially partition says know partition portion array right implement quicksort start partition smaller smaller pieces gonna try partition thing sure works right youll im calling partition test array im partitioning thing 0 end ok thing want want want test bounds ok im know youre asking partition array thats small dont want return ok essentially n equal start plus 1 im gonna return checking sure like start end shouldnt partition end inclusive right im going start test array dot length youre test rate way asked partition value array values im going return immediately ask partition arrays value im going return case actually need partition okay im gonna im going choose pivot value element array asked partition im gonna save im going use algorithm im gonna im gonna value array im need save pivot position pivot position starts start pivot value starts value thats stored slot im want value right place want values right greater equal values left right im gonna array kind standard actually im gonna array starting star plus 1 right dont need consider pivot value right spot end im starting im gonna im looping portion array im working im im saying value array position pivot value okay current value pivot value need things need array stores values smaller pivot larger adjusting pivot position need value right place swapping whats current pivot position right things right increase pivot position second im gonna standard swap im going use temporary variable store current value input array im gonna set current pivot position im gonna set temp temp value okay right things space pivot new value swapped right place array okay im remember look diagram step end array need pivot things look like got end ray im close theres value thats wrong spot pivot die okay way pivot value right place swap value swapped case negative case going pivot position right nice thing ive saved pivot value dont need use temporary verb right im moving value thats currently pivot position start got pivot value set input array pivot position equal pivot value okay pivot value found way right spot dont need temporary variable essentially stored pivot value temporary variable loop needed inside loop compare value array right youre feeling lucky lets works right okay looks right lets think happened pivot value im choosing im trying pivoting entire array partitioning entire array sorry use values pivot thats 8 im theres things need check values right 8 greater equal 8 thats case thats true 11 values left smaller case thats true lets try inputs sure things working expect lets try okay things little little trip little trickier interpret theres forms right question pivot value finished ill look lets look right greater equal right kind depends case fours correct pivot value lets print pivot position function returns lets right pivot position indexed okay thats good look values right pivot greater equal pivot value answer yes values left pivot pivot value strictly answer yes okay lets sure handle couple corner cases lets try smallest value works lets try case largest value works okay think works questions far code weve looked semester probably subtler pieces know imperative programming weve couple different indices track know right okay promised actually going implement quicksort today ill let guys homework lets think performance okay tell run time partition right partition function tell complexity analysis long gonna yeah oh n yeah number values array im partitioning right oh n like n minus start right partition array value 101 partition array 30 values 30 o n right size size array im partitioning okay reason ive got loop right ive got loop starts line 9 loop break statements continue statements unlike insertion sort important understand break im gonna stop soon actually entire array possible value actually smaller pivot needs right spot cant quicksort cant assume values array theres way stop early im gonna entire right okay owen heres quicksort gets fun right promise youd fun lets imagine okay lets imagine pivot value choose step array divided equal parts okay remember merge sort divided arraign equal parts thats log n runtime merge sort quicksort doesnt guarantee array actually going divided half okay picks pivot value moves values right spot respect pivot possible pivot largest value possible pivot smallest value lets imagine choose pivot divides array evenly point analysis looks identical merge sort okay partition thing thats cool quicksort actually works way quicksort actually sorting array descends base case time partitions ray order continue actually accomplished little bit sorting task lets imagine set array size 8 partition divides array arrays size 4 know isnt exactly right technically like 1 array size 3 array size 4 pivot value ignore thats thats important second partition takes smaller arrays divides 4 arrays size 2 final partition takes 4 arrays size 2 know know itd like 1 size 1 pivot value 2 race size 1 im base case look partition function wrote case youre asking partition array thats contains value return dont need partition ok pivot value divides array properly nice performance heres problem problem like said theres guarantee quicksort actually going pick pivot value works alright lets imagine fowler let lets lets actually instrument art code wrote ok washi know lets lets look right ok lets imagine know heres happen choose value thats maximum value okay lets choose value thats middle whats good itll value like 6 ok happen choose pivot value end im array size array size ive problem half small thats good okay choose value like whats happened okay started needing sort array size whats size array sort seven didnt work right sort value time steps going partition creates arrays size continue partition log n steps choose bad partition value heres happens partition partition array arrays size seven partition value sorted second partition partition array erase size size step takes array size partitions keeps going going going im gonna finish ive partition array times right worst case performance quick sort n square remember insertion sort basically kind dressedup version insertion sort moving value right spot time problem getting unit smaller okay questions bad case quicksort right know know heres ah heres thing look data array whats true data like kind like good performance case yeah sorted actually quicksort picked value partition behavior bat array sorted ascending order okay guys wrote code check array sorted takes oh end quicksort going oh squared sort array values sorted right awful right essentially work right sorted descending order im picking value looks identical sorted ascending order pick value partition right tedious alright understanding implement picked quicksort tried try choose good pivot value right try choose pivot value thats going lead type know pathological behavior right values typically bad okay value fail array sorted reverse value fail array sorted ascending order terrible let ask question know value want pick didnt know array want value partitions array equal pieces taken statistics theres special value yeah called median okay feel like incredible breakthrough class found ideal way implement quicksort dont know hasnt thought lets choose median value array partition array know going im gonna equal sized pieces doesnt work sounds like sounds like fantastic idea right like think incredible right mean im gonna win turn work yeah yeah find median sort array pick value thats middle right cant identify median sort data things sorting gets talked fact sorting powerful sort array easily compute basic statistics max min media things like quartiles know based position cant choose median order id solve problem im trying solve right youll median slide actual quicksort implementations theyll things pick random value pick rant value randomly array use pivot want little bit work hoe hopes avoiding kind nasty case choose like values pick median right work little bit better find exhaustive analysis stuff online terms people running different data sets comparing different choices pivots election stuff like right pretty study problem right lets scores quick store big board right best case time complexity o n log n right thats case im creating equal sized arrays time perform partition worst case oh n squared average case depends data right random data randomness data helps picking random pivot value thats close n log n right problem quicksort makes people nervous pathological cases end n squared thats pretty terrible heres thing thats good quicksort dont actually want log n opposed quicksort lot space merge sort reasons people like quicksort swell reasons got attention place remember merge sort needed oh end space trillion values need trillion slots memory order perform merge sort quicksort log n okay actually constant number level right levels depends log n ok thats pretty nice right case quicksort works lot space merge sir variable behavior whats tricky lets think looking comparing sorting albums weve talked talked insertion sort talked merge sort weve talked quicksort insertion sort best case data sorted case insertion sort complete o n right identify right away data sorted worst case data sorted backwards single value moved way array owen squared right merge sort care data looks like appealing property certain uses quicksort best case turns random data worst case sorted direction sort depends d implementation right lets comparison best case insertion sort know best worst average case algorithms right theres thing want point interesting right weve spent little bit time talking merge sort quicksort mainly theyre fun talk achieve optimal performance choose sorting algorithm performs worse oh n log n worst case doesnt broken algorithm insertion sort think talking insertion sort slide heres thing thats found insertion sort sort data actually performs slide actually going o n best case right space usage insertion sort little quick sort thats thats recursive calls step partition needs constant space ended having log partitions right cases know career computer scientist youre faced tradeoffs choose album minute gonna_talk briefly sort modern sorting algorithm thats number different standard libraries languages like java python algorithm based algorithms weve talked tries careful tradeoffs terms uses right turns small array insertion sort actually perform faster doesnt setup time want printer performance mergesort requires lot space gets youre short space quicksort good option okay im gonna skip sorting let quickly theres property sorting algorithms want preserve called stability im gonna seconds worth stable sorts items array value end order original array okay unstable sort items value end different positions okay youre sorting integers think matter turns youre sorting objects based key want sort things twice want sort person case want sort people age list ascending order people youngest oldest way sort sort age sword unstable happens second sort mess results sort right second sort things way dont preserve sorting based okay spend minutes talking tim soras tim swords kind cool right sorting algorithms weve talked talking help learn right sorting albums valuable understand algorithm perspective theyre wild 2000 2003 somebody added story called tim sort python alright default sorting algorithm python java ways think tim sort following okay tim sort complicated going try explain works right knew know design principles okay heres common thing people data lets sorted data array sorted data array essentially append data second right array sort okay essentially bunch sorted data followed bunch sorted data time sort array lets knew sorted parts array work right remember building block use implement algorithm right called step sorted arrays long combine anybody remember yeah oh merge minute merge right tim sort tries tries identify calls runs runs portions data gave sorted oh n values figure half sorted second half sorted combine o n time remember n values long figure theyre sorted algorithm array n values want know sorted algorithm takes long whats oh n yeah takes o n figure sorted takes o n merge things essentially tim sort tries says look wild people dont people dont sort arrays random values sort rays data thats sorted identify parts sorted merge better performance internally actually uses combination bits insertion sort small parts merge sort larger pieces actually pretty clever right example sort thats called adaptive meaning going choose strategy sort data based features data detects run time ok cool cool mean probably seen hopefully somebody repost forum later fun funny youtube video showing sorting algorithms know run think little soundtrack kind fun encourage check day week im going office hours friday 1 3 office hours today guys friday great enjoy couple homework
okay look minutes late sorry alright today good day happen cool code write gonna talking sorting time remember got insertion sort problem oh n squared run time today goal going look ways better okay sweet right main sorting algorithm talking implement completely today merge sort merge sort nice algorithm sense predictable performance heres key insight underlies merge sort difficult sort things sort raise right thats spending couple classes arrays sorted merging straightforward ive got arrays sorted goal combine single sorted array okay ive got sorted arrays goal combine know hard right case arrays sorted descending order know smallest values essentially look values array sorry look value array value array smaller thing okay second array smallest right second array smallest value second array smallest value long smaller im gonna pulling values okay im array im putting values array value second array value term right straightforward process arrays sorted merge lets implement challenge today terrible day happen typing keyboard gonna adventure okay lets oh god dont know away right like thing going im given arrays job merge guys forgot chance homework week whats step whats thing want going sanity checking yeah yeah lets handle null cases actually handle corner cases handle null handle cases arrays right thing want want equal null second equal null case going return dont values merge gonna return array actually array gonna return null right okay lets arrays gave null right lets null condition means seconds gave array null lets handle case length equal zero want gave null array second okay second know value said dont work array array thats values merge return date yeah return second good okay finally condition gonna im gonna similar im basically gonna rewrite im gonna second equal null second length equal zero return good right ive handled corner cases seconds ive like okay guys gonna find today thing youre finding im terrible windows finally oh okay okay years ago college started having wrist problems switched use dvorak keyboard layout way keys different positions ive like 15 years thats looked like total idiot need type keyboard normal layout im im good alright led key observations helping students touch computer cant type computer im gonna look like right ive handled corner cases need lets actually create array combined combined array lets gonna new array needs big hold values arrays alright ive got combined array loop going combined array kind pull things smaller array im gonna need track small early remember im assuming smaller arrays sorted smallest value array currently index 0 smallest value second array currently index 0 im gonna use variables track ive got loop im gonna combined array good old loop syntax right walk alright ive ive set problem ive got loop thats gonna essentially need iteration loop need pick value array second array copy combined array position im going combined array essentially need need look array second array figure smaller stick ok actually actually conditions im gonna yeah yeah okay yeah exactly lets index second second index means array smaller value right value im currently looking array smaller im gonna pull combined array combined equal index im going advance index im looking value row okay ill stuff second array okay going work lets try right got return statement thats kind saying right hes okay scroll little bit pull right im gonna return combined lets run code happens oh okay ive got ive got array index bounds exception happening line 15 happening right whats happening im trying merge arrays size array size bound exception thy god size explain happened try figure little bit whats going yeah yep yeah essentially point im going okay dont know thats gonna depends know values true race point array gonna values second array gonna think way value combined array arrays okay dont know second problem point ive advanced index resund second index past end array doesnt hold valid value okay essentially way handle set conditions gonna statement little bit satisfying index dot length mean index equal dot length mean somebody hasnt volunteered answer today ive gone ive pulling things time yeah yeah right point im advanced index valid values basically end point im gonna instead im gonna pull essentially cut paste code second point values need second nope stop let fullscreen figure right im gonna right successfully cut paste windows computer find apparently real terrible right time option key wow look okay round applause right arrays values need second array remember second array sorted point im pulling things second round improve stop values second array lets outer loop okay right theres thing need right im handling case array values im handling cases arrays values im picking properly theres case need handle similar remember dont know rays gonna run values yeah arrays im close right ill point arrays yeah essentially piece code second array right second index equal second dot lane means second array pick array cut paste stop cut paste code okay gotten sort gnarlier want actually complicated conditions need handle arrays arrays data need array erase takes second array second array story okay line 21 means race theyll data thats snowing cool need pick smaller bout right im conditional based value item right lets try solved problem array index bounds okay ive successfully merged arrays lets try corner cases defensive programmers lets try case smallest values array array larger values okay sure works like turn sure works im pretty confident right okay questions like hard mean degree merge sort hard implement hard havent actually implemented sorting algorithm weve weve implemented arrays sorted arrays emerge youre going cool merge sort use build recursive sorting algorithm implement recursive sorting algorithm come grab code actual additional code need write point small right questions good sort recursive sorry imperative programming review know things thats conceptually hard little bit tricky translate code okay question actually use lets talk runtime time complexity ok lets look implementation ok steps going talk heres heres algorithm heres implementation algorithm sorry sorry steps require yeah yeah merge arrays size m gonna n okay level think n representing size combined array oh okay combined array going contain n values know function right combined arrays gonna right know values gonna combined array oh n size combined array loop goes array time fancy theres break continue theres nested loops im array axises comparisons constant time operations okay cool thing right theres data dependence right look theres like loop gonna run combined array size times doesnt matter whats second right like insertion sort breaks stuff like going depend data okay worst case o n best cases oh average case owing thats like merge sort predictable right merge predictable hey arrays size combined size gonna oh n demers sort know cases little bit better performance particularly arrays values right general away right way weve implemented dependence values second long going behavior algorithm depends values second runtime right okay ive weve sort worked observation easy merge arrays sorted order use actually build sorting algorithm okay question sorted arrays come right gave stories size didnt tell sort arrays think merge step took choose sorted arrays size created sorted array size ingredients need recursive algorithm way combine results sorted arrays ill combine bigger sorted array im merging results smaller problems solution bigger problem right question problems smaller big problem small start build combined solutions answer property arrays looked talked fact arrays recursive data structures sub array array contiguous section array isnt right right think array values think arrays values left think erase values array left think array value breaking big problem smaller problems whats kind cool know array break lets break pieces im going split half array size create small arrays size n arrays break arrays size whats smallest subproblem know break problem pieces know pieces whats smallest sub problem im gonna stop solve media right know build bigger arrays sorted arrays smaller sorted arrays whats know know big array break smaller arrays array thats sorted yeah yeah ray value sorted okay start array thats value sorted use merge function bigger sorted array sorted right sort rate bigger sorted array continue ive sorted entire array right ingredients need recursive solution sorting cool right problem smaller breaking array parts im going talk runtime merge sort actually particularly talk runtime quicksort wednesday things thats important note size arrays matters merge sort im gonna try break im gonna break arrays equal pieces array size im gonna end size size array size seven equal right important run time heres gonna work gonna break problem problem smaller breaking arrays smaller pieces theyre roughly size smallest sub problem array thats value im md array sorted array size sorted okay ive solved problem created sorted array merge use merge function okay right merge sort base case weve reached array value zero value right happens arrays divide recursive step split array pieces combined result nice merge function wrote right wrote merge know combine results right thing need know im going use example need figure split array order finish job need know step okay implement function guys point far smart implement function lets bother lets use helper function exists arrays library theres library java library contains bunch functions run rate dont important thing arrays java object contain length property dont actually dont methods static methods array argument interesting things example theres use thats particularly useful thats called copy range right copy range takes bunch different types arrays gonna use int copies specific specified range returns reference new array right notice bunch sorting functions right sort arrays right thats little bit thats actually werent trying learn implement sorting going use ones built john alright thing lets lets merge code lets rescue merge code earlier yeah want write know cut paste grab oop undo find ah sweet cozy controlc lets right going cool right lets drop merge great merge code wrote goal use implement merge sort right merge sort recursive algorithm whats base case argument input array whats base case smallest problem know know stop yeah yeah equal yeah input array size im gonna input array dot length equal return input array array sorted okay know kind kind cool need need things basically sort right half half need sort left half right actually lets start left little think left half values array im going sort right half im going merge results okay know merge right essentially lets int equal sort heres im gonna use function arrays library going going copy half input array arrays dot copy range zero input array dot length second im gonna im gonna sort right recursive steps second lets left thats called left half array right half result running sorry got fix im throwing half array think chuck style gonna lets like okay recursive steps im writing little bit longer minute kind happens right remember recursive function im base case dont know solve problem know problem smaller ive ive said dont know sort array zero elements got im gonna break pieces rely fact eventually ill know sort making problem smaller smaller im gonna small sub problems okay point sorted copy left half array sorted copy right half array need finish job right dont know merge sort function works right know eventually sort array sorted arrays containing values array containing values second array need glue come hacen tributed yeah yeah im gonna merge yeah thats wanted hear im gonna merge right merge function takes left right array essentially im im gonna merge left right thats merge function takes know second array returns new array twice values sorry number length times like okay lets actually works oh chuck styles mad hey brackets legal position weird oh sorry yes declaring reference array uhhuh look magic right like said recursive code complicated questions talk little bit runtime appealing following way lets lets return dont create temporary erase return merge merge sort common im combining rid temporary arrays works okay questions recursive sorting algorithm ive got base case statement im combining recursive steps problem smaller looking half input array second half input array im calling merge sort sort im return sorted copy half race copy second half array use merge glue right lets talk little bit long going little tricky getting intuition right lets walk example lets walk example carefully chosen value number right power thats helpful im thinking okay lets think im sorting array values merge think way okay merge step essentially taking array brought problem small small small finally found erases size merge merges arrays size 1 4 arrays size 2 thats 4 oh merges n 2 okay o 8 right 4 times o n second merge takes 4 arrays size 2 merges 2 arrays size 4 ive oh n merchants n 4 right remember runtime merge step depends big arrays oh n merges 4 4 thats oh 8 step ive got final merge takes arrays size array original value center sort okay thats oh n merge n 8 whats_interesting level contributes om right oh set merges n 8 size original array okay merges gets smaller larger im fewer okay ive got o oh n 1o n second went drives runtime step merge level going wet right drives long going number levels right level contributes oh levels o n turns thinking thinking realized 8 8 log 2 3 okay time problem half small bird talked o log run times weve said frequently associated recursive function recursive algorithm end o n log n runtime best sorting win know best sorting algorithm worst case right implemented sorting algorithm sorting algorithm find worst case certainly islands lot better best case better achieves optimal performance time right heres visualization sort things coming right 8 values ive merged 4 sorted arrays second level merge sorted arrays level ive got sorted array number levels login size array step os combine ghetto login okay think stop pick wednesday sorry technical difficulties today stay warm looks like blizzard going snowball fight joy beautiful snow guys
music started upper deck volume okay right pull cant hear okay dont big agenda today goal 15 minutes prepare midterm week okay know important checkpoint class coffee yeah cold ill post video later right wants midterm sync dont want write midterm soon know things lot class try sure guys okay youre moving forward appropriate pace thats midterm exams format quiz long cumulative programming component emphasized little bit questions book people pleased guess know goal know assessments class goal sure know think know know thinking courses work courses took college workroom like showed went

better better prepare better better okay format midterm yeah goal sure youre ready poorly gonna conversation future class right poorly relative goal sure youre ready succeed rest spend yeah oh better ive got thing way way im going thankfully theres video slides better okay hear hear okay coffee thats cant hear right format midterm exam 12 multiplechoice questions needs largely code reading questions multiple sort simple like whats type variable question gone quiz questions midterm questions gonna read code arent theyre little bit theyre little bit medium programming questions middle race tell midterm multidimensional ranks talked week theres strings drink water listening guys ball okay heres promise questions midterm available practice homework 125 practice problem set im gonna tell understand works question drawn directly homework youve morning class published old quiz questions old homework homework problem today way guys little bit break ill monday format exam questions yeah whats programming questions telling going drawn practice problems world available practice questions hour long usual yeah solve problem way want yeah ill going later actually substrate based solutions yeah clever solutions rotate string problem substring function hint find camera think hit yeah great question question string methods expected familiar weve use homework problem know exists know provide documentation string class exam youll available want hunting clock ticking cvt f dont think know knowing theres function called splint little bit use knowing strings length function knowing theres equality method strings useful things yeah questions book metric yes guys getting wrong theyre easy right questions yeah review multiplechoice questions quizzes programming questions quizzes 125 problems want look multiplechoice questions find ta office hours guys losing distinction tas graduate students cas undergraduates lot cs tas tas allowed look home quiz scores learn cs come

point breakdown think good question think programming questions worth half ill yeah asked forum ill pitch oh right good question partial credit programming pressure dont remember think answer yes check questions okay lets problems actually said open review session question content problem theyd like yeaah okay rotate left guys want look rotate left yeah okay lets ive got slides alright rotate right string rotate characters right certain number know based parameter thats passed solve problem rotating string left okay heres im going approach problem ways actually minute ill ways approach problem good need work okay heres heres suggestion approached usually easier work im rotations range use modular arithmetic let things wrap little bit indices thats im going thing im gonna im gonna string im gonna convert array characters know strings fundamentally imperative changing representation little bit im taking string im gonna use filton string functions extract array characters im gonna work array im ill return string ill array characters ive left ill return strength im going need im going string character character know character string end new string im creating trick figure inside loop know things remember ramp associated piece metadata piece data array array data array characters metadata index need work index know character going array im creating dont know need figure know new index im gonna copy character new array im im ill array return trick right lets im gonna declare function returns string called rotate left string input lets return input sure ive declared function oh need parameter okay rotation oh function signatures wrong good oh sp static right theres starting point prairie lerner didnt add static pretty okay lets algorithm guys working problems like oh cb tf mp strongly suggest code write figuring happened blind tests putting print statements trying examine whats going code write likely youre going headed right direction thing needed able figure array string recall correctly care array lets try okay work actually lets print length array sure things properly okay work hadnt know thats know asked string functions remember good remember right array characters string great need need output array need new array im gonna create new character array big output array size input array im gonna new care input array sure works okay good im gonna write loop goes character array lets sure loop works wrong oh sorry told making simple mistakes right looks like im retrieving indices properly actually rotation lets wrapper code lets lets rotate string lets characters spot new array output array ill int rotated index equal eventually im gonna need work add rotation code im gonna output array rotated index equal input array instead returning input im gonna return string created output array okay ive got know encourage guys youre trying write complex pieces code right simple thing kind like fiddly stuff know function right right work bit okay definitely need right lets think lets try lets try cs 125 rotated laughed place im position character new strength know want left add im moving right subtract im moving left lets try rotated index equal minus rotation okay lets happens im sort im im think im right track try running code problem problem error message indicates array index bounds exception tells right bad index okay right looks like line 7 actually whats happening try use rotated index copy character new array im trying copy invalid place ok whats problem whats going wrong think happens time come loop zero rotation rotation negative valid inda lets think whats right place im rotating left string length whats right place character index zero rotated index equal negative ones wrong want rotate right frame whats position end string blank valid index yeah right lets try right like know need add special case rotated index zero im gonna im going flip going negative going add 5 gonna 4 work happen cases ive gone left negative 2 3 right lets try ah ok thats interesting happened looks like problem right missed okay lets zero happens okay 0 ive got ive got things correct right lets debugging logic try whats going thing encourage guys youre oh got add plus okay okay theres bug coat programmer makes mistakes wrong bug bounties morning yeah whats yeah problem right wanted send zero position 4 setting epson isnt sending position 0 wrong wheres buck yeah yeah problem im rotation want use input array thing want use length string okay ive got correct result great okay right im gonna leave little piece debugging logic think need minute useful thing youre working problems right lets try values lets try works work lets try work okay lets try alright works oh okay problem know writing thought right right know want think carefully test cases supposed work rotation right works fixed number itll work gonna work negative indices okay right rotation itll work problem missing yeah yeah lets try debugging logic youll im problem zero going going negative actually use use larger value youre gonna gonna worse ive got negative indices theres place need use modulus sure index stays rain remainder operator jobs place right compute original rotated index im going insert modulus operator thats gonna sorry lying modulus important remember job okay things thats sad java little quirks language languages like python actually modulus negative java remainder operator negative programming languages need conversation guys programming languages need insert particular piece code check negative indices java okay think getting close actually looks right let debugging statement lets okay lets lets check values lets check zero works lets check works lets check multiple started values try havent tried try arbitrarily large positive values example 10 5 times 125 im gonna right answer work happened tested okay im trying test code need test negative values lets try good thing theyre defensive programming 101 whats gonna happen remember gonna try code crash person future itll somebody therell user right thing im going input validation input null ill return im good okay questions output print statements quizzes im sorry obvious looks sort buried output trailer like point double check guys remind forum weve print statements turned right little bit tricky interpret try lots different test cases want look need look yeah thats questions okay let want fun okay im going right minutes heres later class going start giving points homework problems right want talk little bit good code hygiene want talk good bad ways solve problems right im gonna im gonna example good example im gonna submissions actual students like semesters right actual student submissions submissions passed test cases right point view tests correct perfect consider good lets look lets look couple im gonna post slide dont want share okay let grab find thats oh okay hold actually thats good heres okay heres good yeah chuck stiles gonna angry thats okay im gonna fix start taking look lets think gonna fix chuck style airs quickly want actually works code correct good right works working code let pull lets lets critique know came office hours weeks ago pointed theres lot musical analogies terms teach computer science flats example daily homework practice thats like practicing instrument quizzes like lessons right guys coming week like recital goal little bit like master class student submission correct passed test suites student got credit like reviewing work software company youre hiring someones hiring okay lets look misconceptions code places clean little bit alright wants started yeah yeah okay like right oh second parameter alright lot options mean called shift called rotation distance okay okay good like good descriptive variable names right good place start yeah yeah honest reasons concern pour tis im creating new variable length length input right isnt necessary use input dot length actually connected feature problem long theres fair unnecessary code think thats person wrote decided got tired typing putdown length actually didnt need use length okay heres sign code isnt perfect remove things work want crack theres code toss impact practice youll want suggest couple lines statement throw overboard love way like best building software getting rid unnecessary stuff yeah lines yeah basically saying length zero overturned input whats gonna happen length zero im gonna oh know actually know right need lets look lets try lets start getting rid im gonna comment case eventually want right let sure zero works lets try zero length input ah thats try use zero modulus going fit cant rid yeah yeah isnt check dont need okay lets try works okay know argue code efficient like know particularly guys getting started like job write code beautiful concise right adding lot special_cases like isnt necessarily good way okay fairly glaring kind kind awful okay youve noticed line 11 thats problem want elaborate line 11 dont like lot yeah whats happening time array im reconverting input array characters right happens happens okay theres couple theres theres different ways change converted use array function going change theres way anybody remember strings helpful function use sort little bit messy incorrect theres better way solve problem trying accomplish actually trying bat particular string value particular character string strings way yeah use care act yeah accomplish thing like right makes happy works yeah yeah question need statement thats great thats great question remember rotate right rotate right doesnt sum rotate right doesnt problems rotate left question need whats hypothesis dont need argument needing particular statement yeah yeah mod right id use remainder operator careful way applied remainder operator index greater length lets code lets oh need notice modulus applied mysterious parameter renamed makes sure index smaller length start adding possible index grow outside smarter thing index plus mod remainder length okay oh sorry plus im gonna mod thats position mad okay dont need right ive rid piece code like said kind happy break gave problem promised rotation positive break whats input value thats gonna cause fail yeah try negative boom heres problem rotate right negative values essentially rotate laughing handle case applying module remainder operator negative solution rotate right rotate left starts look similar fact correct solution identical need handle inputs negative rotate right youre left rotation gave negative input rotate left youre right work okay okay let want sort fun want guys sense youre going youre wrong track right promise ask solve problem class write piece code looks like im find writing like come talk okay im theres way im gonna fix czech style theres caused indentation right try promise works perfect okay awful theres actually lot things wrong wont oh missed rest yeah sorry let hold know point showing know main point showing hold solution actually checks entire board manually inside fl state pretty impressive know lot time energy writing right find youre like said point showing simply emphasize following point theres lot ways help class find writing piece code looks like ask help likely wrong okay nobodys code thats class right right questions wrap little bit early today wish guys best luck yeah dont know hesitate ask long time mean ways delicate solution took need long time right okay announcement midterm exam week grade dropped need midterm week miss contact cbt app reschedule right ill office 1 2 3 today want stop questions concerns monday start topical unit class discussion objects mp 0 weekend good luck finishing mp 1 released actually weekend chance start looking dont expect lap middle wonderful weekend good luck midterm
hi come everybody welcome new season apparently hope everybody enjoyed halloween doesnt matter tempted dress today callings kind wednesday semester maybe year thats chance alright today gonna talking recursion introduced idea time theres concept thats programming strategy today gonna look recursive approach solving problem simple problem figuring nodes binary tree schematically review time actually gonna write piece recursive code fun essentially kind thing gonna week little bit longer homework problems today start tree recursion gonna continue pattern guys gonna maybe little tired writing tree recursive algorithms great practice recursion things know particularly new think understand need different ways kind starts click whats actually happening okay good news class midterm congratulations better semester better year actually happy new mp checkpoint release weekend thats gonna game comes know opportunity drop mp hope wont hope youll complete process actually point fully functional snake game playin use guys finish think kind rest semester works weeks thanksgiving mp checkpoints gonna consume youre machine project gonna started final project lab week thanksgiving start discussions identify partner goal time want cool final project work thanksgiving okay know whats happening know month half left class week thanksgiving theres quizzes midterm midterm comes right thanksgiving break final project fair need set date soon know whats happened okay lets review tree terminology time started talking commonly data structure computer science called tree tree consists series nodes organize structure particular way node parent node root node root node tree node doesnt parent node tree linked parent node node doesnt store reference parent thats way think node parent parents general tree talk zero children trees work class primarily theyre going children special case tree known binary tree review quickly terminology refer talking know essentially look tree individual node parent children node children children descendants parent child think reversing arrow reference parent node roots okay children parent node divine tree parent root refer tree way look course invert diagrams work refer node tree parents root node algorithms going use going start root fact shouldnt binary tree class going look today working week information stores tree reference root node sort similar saw linked lists list data structure stored reference start item item linked list tree stores reference root nodes find starting root start root find root nodes children find childrens children stuff like rest nodes tree labeled nodes nodes children refer leaf nodes tree nonempty tree root non negative treat leaf node tree node root leaf tree node right didnt tree infinite size right talk depth tree depth depth determined talk sorry depth node tree depth particular node determined hops takes root node node root node thinking nodes tree children root depth takes hop root notes nodes tree higher depths takes longer reach started root hop note level second hop note level leaf node hops level height tree maximum number steps takes reach leaf node guys actually write algorithm compute couple homework problems given tree figure height essentially need find leaf nodes figure leaf node took longest steps reach okay lets start looking recursive algorithm tree presented time didnt implement today talking know good starting point good starting point recursive solution algorithm extremely elegant simple couple lines long conceptually little tricky figure works lets walk going approach problem recursively designing recursive algorithm writing recursive code talking problem solving strategy counts number nodes tree recursively heres general approach designing recursive algorithms step algorithm need couple things thing problem smaller problem big solve know problem smaller solve smaller problems come solution firt problem thats thing theres certain point reach algorithm cant problem smaller ive problem small possible means reach leaf node reach yeah reach leaf node needs reach tree come action minute point problem small shouldnt need smaller solve point solution evident thing ill need figure way combine results smaller problems combine solution bigger problem things algorithm problem smaller solve problem gets small combine solutions smaller problems solve bigger problem eventually solve bigger problem right im gonna break problem know rigorous sort designed way eventually gets small easy solve combine solutions simple problems solution slightly simple problem slightly bigger problem slightly complicated problem eventually solve problem started right heres gonna counting okay heres big problem trying solve trying count nodes tree mind dont know nodes reference tree reference node value thats reference root okay gonna break problem smaller subproblems mean heres proposal given tree size tree given node tree size tree thats rooted node need count node plus number nodes left subtree node zero plus number nodes sorry right subtree left subtree left subtree right subtree okay ive actually proposed way problem smaller left subtree right sub gonna fewer nodes entire tree left subtree gonna fewer nodes thats smaller problem right subtree gonna fewer nose thats smaller problem notice ive im proposing way combine results combined adding add nodes right subtree sorry left subtree notes right subtree sure count node thats current route okay heres node thats current route thats know nodes tree idea nodes fives left subtree idea nodes 5s right subtree knew knew nodes left subtree right subtree tell nodes integra tree okay think im belaboring essential step going repeat okay ive got smaller problems count number nodes tree thats smaller original tree tree rooted node tree rooted node 10 count nodes tree routed note 10 nodes tree root node 3 im good solve puzzle right lets lets lets continue okay lets examine smaller subproblems count number nodes tree rooted node 3 okay let try applying strategy dont know count total_number nodes tree know count number nodes threes left subtree number nodes 3ds right subtree add answer problem actually getting easier node 3 doesnt right subtree okay know things getting better let start im restarting algorithm called recursive algorithm keeps restarting pretending seven root tree seven root tree nodes tree trick question ill node doesnt right subtree left subtree number nodes yeah smallest possible subproblem ive solved node children im know like wait okay told count number notes left subtree right subtree right subtree left subtree zero zero know answer right answer okay good lets im thing im reapply algorithm id want count tree tree root node children count right subtree left subtree add im thing ive reached leaf node ive reached problem solve immediately smallest possible subproblem thats solve point cant making problem smaller theres smaller problem solve ive identified smallest possible problem im gonna okay heres second stage write win right recursive algorithm think stages particularly trees sort natural way think think im kind working way find smaller subproblems tree right thing separated tree left half right half smaller original tree im identifying smaller smaller smaller solve combine results kind thats start solve complicated problems simple solutions merge solution complicated problem okay left im gonna solution nodes tree rooted node seven combine solution trees nodes tree doesnt exist zero thing know nodes tree didnt know know nodes tree rooted node heres got know essentially told count number nodes right subtree left subtree know nodes subtree count number nodes tree rooted seven know nodes tree rooted seven got mated said hey number nodes tree root goes okay know nodes tree rooted thing 10 10 said hey count number nodes tree rooted left subtree number nodes tree rooted node right subtree know nodes tree rooted 10 number nodes right subtree plus number nodes left subtree plus im solving complicated problems started trying count number nodes tree knew nodes broke problem counting number nodes tree nodes number nodes tree nodes im ready finish job solutions gone way started said hey count number nodes fives left subtree thats rooted count number nodes fives right subtree rooted 10 know nodes entire tree got said hey theres nodes tree thats rooted said theres nodes tree thats rooted finish job fives root node come nodes tree oh okay questions know hurts brain explain im sure hurts brain look okay forth algorithm code lets implement okay guys gonna surprised hope easy lets look code couple minutes tree structure gonna use lot week okay ive got sort good object review class called binary tree new static field thats type random im gonna explain minute okay inner class called node sort like list remember list inner class called item node tree binary tree node zero children refer left right node data structure stores value remember want store data tree use data later algorithms trees counting number notes data sort irrelevant way store reference object sort kind data want tree right child reference node left reference node constructor created sets value okay line 13 theres lot code gonna gonna add theres certain thats needed kind set tree theres actually recursive algorithm im gonna right thing tree needs know needs reference root node thats tree references stored tree find root find right child left child find right left children essentially explore entire tree right ive got root node heres want look minute dont want explain great detail want guys freaked simple believe okay question purposes running examples need way build tree build tree want able essentially want able add nodes tree want list objects want way add tree order examples sort interesting want able add want carried random tree trees created algorithm contain values array thats passed constructor object values tree theres couple rules things look minute okay added add object tree function called add look constructor takes list object references adds tree teeps keeps calling add add add calls add root node adds new value tree heres add function works takes arguments reference current node thats current place going try add note second value add thats sorry thats current place gonna try add value tree possible note lets lets imagine run algorithm run root note time root null add node right away note add tree root note add note roots left child add node roots right child problem point im know im spot right reach root node ive ive actually provided recursive add algorithm little bit trickier lets look happens inside add function root node null time cut gets called theres root node root node null set create root node creating new node value passed studying root reference note point tree node heres goes random reference random java standard library collection methods random values things ask random ask random random int random double things random boolean gives random yes value random true false half time random boolean going return true im going enter statement half time going return false im going enter half statement half statement heres current node doesnt right child current right equal null add value current node right child thing random boolean false current node doesnt left add node current nodes left child heres things interesting add restart algorithm right subtree current node left subtree essentially algorithm works follows says im gonna try add node half time im going try add right half time im going try add left node doesnt right child thats ive decided ill add right child ill add right subtree node node doesnt left child thats ive decided ill add left node left child ill restart algorithm left subtree recursive alvin right essentially making problem adding value smaller time adding smaller sub tree theres likely space okay thats sophisticated recursive algorithm expect understand right wanted talk quickly right heres gonna gonna write provided recursive string function guys look alright code work creates trees properly add im creating tree integers add interest want tree string function prints values tree lets figure count number values tree want implement size function okay lot times look look string function public string function takes arguments calls private string function different signature gonna lot work trees write recursive algorithm gonna gonna start recursive algorithm root note right lets lets use structure size im gonna create private method called sighs private method takes takes reference node count essentially root subtree want count number nodes okay size im essentially going return size started root right gonna thing havent implemented recursive algorithm okay lets whats went right simplest subproblem able identify point solve problem theres certain tree able count immediate know ive reached point yeah yeah current left equal null current dot right equal null turn 0 im node remember right gets run note close im counting im counting tree node children size tree yeah lets return okay recursive algorithm known base case point continue problem smaller theres smaller problems found node theres children able count tree theres way theres smaller problems theres right subtree theres left subtree okay lets lets heres im gonna im gonna create value let count set size sizes function im initializing count 1 sure count okay smaller problems want solve ok cant count nodes tree know smaller problems want solve met node know node right subtree left subtree maybe right whats smaller subproblems want solve okay size left subtree right lets count plus equals size current dot left okay brain going start explode little bit im function im calling function weird pod theres reason doesnt work right sort like worries aside minute actually okay im function called size supposed count number nodes little comment count number nodes tree rooted current left sub child need code isnt right help run probably going cause problem yeah left subtree lets fix lets current left equal im gonna count left subtree right need yeah yeah cant ignore right subtree right im gonna essentially thing im gonna right subtree number nodes tree routed increased nodes right subtree essentially 1 plus number nodes left subtree plus oh wait sorry thats right count plus equals 1 plus number nodes left subtree plus number nodes right subtree okay im gonna change return count lets went oh man check style guys signed yeah seven right lets look lets look example seven ill look story lets nodes oh thats right okay recursive algorithm recursive algorithm book tell provide input cause crash tell yeah kern current normally im gonna start algorithm current null theres special case yeah way whats okay length zero link zero yeah oh okay lets try root node works youre close heading right direction guy boom happened root null ran algorithm sorry let things closer example code messing ill strings stuff better okay heres problem example root set called size root started root current valid reference lets im going handle case okay good right okay correct thing closely matches talked went diagram questions want slowly stuff stuff totally totally like mean remember dont remember 20 years ago literally 20 years ago semester took programming time remember recursion struggling recursion confused unusual feel queasy weirded little bit type approach okay let lets going characteristic tree algorithms gonna lot nicer okay promised going simple works correct kind kind nice like okay heres im gonna propose right stopping recursive algorithm gets leafs right look code leaf node known base case current node left right child leaf node return heres im gonna propose lets let algorithm leaf nodes reference lets imagine allow algorithm walk leaf nodes walk essentially tree reference tree reference trees right child seven references trees references trees represent tree whats size tree tree node thats null whats size tree rooted zero right imagine ask nodes sevens left subtree answer zero right notes sevens right subtree answer zero heres gonna gonna little lines 56 59 means weve walked end tree got followed left reference root right reference led tree didnt nodes trees size zero let gonna following okay size tree 1 plus size current left plus size current dot right gonna work lets try nodes lets like works okay looks nice okay working lets linger minute think code deleted lot avoiding know right happens current left null problem couldnt size reference wasnt safe point base case reference reference null tree know answer know nodes zero write write algorithm recursive algorithm pleasing way right makes happier computer scientist says nodes tree plus number nodes left subtree plus number nodes right subtree thats exactly worked went diagram difference left reference know left subtree zero nodes right reference null right subtree zero nodes size algorithms size gonna handle walk tree gonna theres nodes right questions typically going write recursive algorithms reason theres nicer right look know look started right started okay deleted 10 lines code gotta recreate replace line code dont want sort encourage idolize code thats short thats actually good actually reading creator python guido im gonna try pronounce apparently went work dropbox dropbox company maybe youve heard apparently dropbox python lot internally dont know know decided work lot python work person created python language apparently things spent lot time encouraging engineers stop writing clever code find code overly clever clear know probably gets longer right stop cute design things right know shorter algorithm better longer algorithm lines code thats easy understand frequently superior case line distills exactly algorithm counts number counts number nodes left subtree number nodes right subtree think clearer formulation gonna future gonna handle null base case figure allow essentially walk tree right know questions yeah yeah yeah question sighs inside sighs answer figure later dont want complicated essentially size inside size behaves like function start root lets lets hard come later idea size root node let let let let example little smaller okay size route heres happens size function starts running running root node root node value 1 gets line says oh need run size function calls size current dot left copy size waiting second copy finish second copy size starts running says um called work gets calls size ive got copies size running im 4 im gonna size dot left size dot right functions going return right away theyre gonna null reference second copy size gonna finish copy size going size right thing going happen theres difference mean want think whats happening internally fine theres difference calling function inside function calling function inside function string right function inside function function gets called work function called function waits complete proceed theres difference fact im calling function sort anomaly thats structure problem yeah sighs methods right idea dont want great question root nodes private tree class going expose structure people use gonna know dont need know implement tree tree ive got leaves ive got nodes good want use ill tell want know nodes inside tree size im calling size arguments right outside class doesnt cant access root node right internally ok want know number nodes tree called size function starts root yeah great question thats overload gonna time right recursive functions alright let guys advice recursion tricky concept hard started takes practice youre going practice youre gonna okay thing write recursive algorithm eventually stop process making problem smaller reach end cant continue indefinitely cant try continue indefinitely program going end okay known base case thats point solving puzzle base case current null thats point dont size im ive walked tree theres nodes count okay problems smaller step step algorithm simmer isnt making problem smaller youre going stop problem smaller smaller smaller eventually point problem thats small solve known recursive step im calling size left subtree fewer nodes tree thats smaller problem im calling size right subtree fewer nodes entire tree thats smaller okay finally figuring combine results ive got line line things solving smaller problems number nodes left subtree number nodes right subtree combining results says number nodes tree rooted number nodes left subtree plus number nodes right subtree plus count right heres heres example recursive algorithm dont want guys think confined trees implementation factorial right factorial number number multiplied number smaller right like talked features heres base case factorial 1 1 thats problem know solve know factorial number number times factorial number thats smaller ive got recursive heres recursive step im calling factorial n minus 1 heres combining results right base case n equals 1 recursive step calling factorial n minus 1 thats makes problem smaller im going 1 hope combining results multiplying current value times factorial number thats small right heres problem reach base case remember stop point ill guys know little problem break today code fail code fail reach base case yeah yeah zero negative number yeah whats gonna happen im gonna okay need compute factorial negative computing multiplying negative times factorial negative right okay compute factorial negative compute factor multiply negative times negative right compute factor negus factorial maybe combining multiply negative negative factorial negative seven right going right going try run code playground youre gonna runtime error essentially men means got kept calling factorial trying solve problem werent making problem small werent getting base case okay pick monday dont announce today hope guys great weekend stay warm new climate good luck finishing mp3 checkpoint guys
right today going stop recursive examples trees thats today talk little bit use recursion look factorial example ended class friday example recursive algorithm use tree know danger like gonna gonna lot practice trees ways nice fit recursion dont want conflate closely recursion problemsolving strategy use variety different problems variety different data structures wednesday look little bit recursion non tree data structures sort drive point home today practice gonna writing recursive algorithms going trees right guys nice weekend lets started know hope new idea recursion solve problems things like ive warned takes practice getting time thinking whats happening goal today know goal today try help know dont huge cover today going spend time examples ask questions know little weird right started strategies follow find helpful design recursive algorithms okay remember recursion problemsolving strategy solves problems family algorithms sort feature algorithms involve solving problems trying problem smaller thats goal figure way big problem complicated problem simpler boil little bit break smaller pieces know stop know point weve reached problem thats small need able solve recursive algorithm known base case building recursive algorithm lot times recursive function near recursive implementation algorithm thing check okay m base case place need stop thats thing right second problem smaller step performing tries problem smaller actually doesnt produce smaller problems recursive algorithm point creates problems small solve itll finish itll job trees time tear tree pieces time look right left subtree node whats critical trees smaller tree thats rooted node dont contain node know right subtree contain nodes left subtree left subtree doesnt contain nodes right subtree know weve essentially created smaller problems right thats recursion reasons recursion works nicely trees talked recursion lists wednesday know recursive problem makes problem smaller produces starts smaller list list n elements reduce problem solving list n minus 1 elements problem smaller continue eventually ill list element solve easily big designing good recursive algorithms figuring ive solved small problems combine results help solve bigger problem bigger problem function solution smaller problems exactly exactly results right looked time nice example recursion couple reasons data structures mathematical function compute recursively factorial factorial n n times minus times minus times minus fact actually sort recursive definition right factorial equal factorial equal n times factorial n minus continue defined way factorial 1 1 right heres recursive recursive implication factorial thing base case remember problem smaller problem smaller actually mean computing factorial smaller integer actually computing smaller tree smaller list means smaller actually mean smaller number right know answer definition factorial 1 1 im gonna problem smaller im gonna ok dont know compute factorial n know definition factorial n n times factorial n minus 1 ive problem small alright heres base case write case n equal 1 youll reach base case important way identify base case reach base case theres recursive youll ask factorial 1 know dont need compute based factorial number alright theres function theres definition right definition factorial factorial 1 equal recursive step making problem smaller thats factorial n minus 1 dont know compute factorial n know definition n times factorial n minus 1 ive produced smaller problem right im trying compute factor smaller integer finally combination results multiplication step right example different function dont know maybe theres right different function sum numbers n replace product symbol sum definition factorial factorial n n times factorial n minus okay meets criteria set recursive algorithm implementation recursive algorithm remember problem smaller actually reach base case common problem recursive functions think theyre making problem smaller way actually reaches base case theyve set time end class somebody pointed start function negative number 0 started im good start going 2 times factorial 1 started 4 gonna 4 times factorial 3 times factorial 2 right gonna work started zero algorithm gonna ok dont know factorial zero told compute factorial zero saying zero times factorial negative 1 kind dumb right soon zero product stop doesnt matter numbers ive play results going zero lets negative 1 negative 1 according factorial negative 1 negative 1 times factorial negative 2 factorial negative 2 negative 2 times factorial negative 3 thats factorial negative 3 3 types doctoral negative 4 finish going going going eventually gonna run run memory right try run let works lets print statement number trying compute factorial dont think gonna let tried hard right kept going going going trying trying asked lot time lot time time eventually happen computer memory run computation job realize wrong program killed right stack overflow error come talk little bit later class talk errors exceptions think sign went wrong right able solve puzzle wasnt approaching alright refer approaching base case recursive algorithm step approach base case base case recursive step isnt approaching start negative number started positive number im fine right okay let uh let offer caveat places know training computer scientist think actually exercise fair discretion fair know maybe aesthetic judgment let let clarify thing right people people people weird ideas problems solve recursion solve iterative approach problems solve iteration cant solve recursive approach fact programming languages dont loops okay far problemsolving strategies theyre completely complementary pick problem find recursive way solve recursive solution stupid good recursive algorithm problem cases shouldnt cases choice right produce iterative solution problem produce recursive solution problem youre starting started semester looking loops looking studying variables things like essentially trained think lot introductory computer science courses lot raised iterative programmers count encounter recursion things feel like tends happen bad right thing happens people scared theyre like dont im gonna way tend shun recursive approaches wont use right thats bad way thing thats bad people like cool use impress friends dont understand recursion start implementing recursion places appropriate hey course know right place things life middle ground right forces judgment calls right recursive solutions difficult understand argue times solve problem computer scientist goal produce clear concise solution actually ways going help ill talk minute upcoming programming problems goal write code clear understandable designed look good impress people right people impressed code ones use mess little bit like clear documented intelligible right thats impresses people fact use particular programming technique okay iterative solution clear use right recursive solution clear use right thats simplest way tradeoff simple sense easy principle understand hard apply people tend sort allornothing recursion theyre like id want birol recursion time im going use recursion place produce solution clear okay applying discretion difficult practice experience right dont doesnt impress anybody dont use recursion like oh man function cool know like cares right want want solve problems way thats clear integrated pieces code shared okay heres thing hear people like recursive dacian shorter dont care know like guys seen obfuscated code competitions seen theres competitions like writing piece code completely understandable useful right actually remember wrote mp3 decoder like line goes like thousands characters right variable like letter know cant heads tails thats happening decodes mp3s work okay like goal right number lines code solution measure good takes 200 lines solve problem solved 20 lines problem right takes 30 lines 30 lines understandable 20 lines youre winner okay code length use programming community evaluate contributions clarity okay lets come factorial heres example way skin particular cat iterative approach factorial think differences techniques encourage sidebyside mind tree examples right hard require data structures guys havent worked homra problems factorial like iterative factorial recursive factorial compare computes factorial computes factorial loop number loops kind nice right start result set 1 2 number wanted compute factorial multiplying result number thats factorial correct work recursive solution correct work right indistinguishable terms correctness prefer let actually hands people like version better cursive version okay people liked recursive version better version okay like yeah thing thats nice recursive closer mathematical definition factorial kind nice right depends problem use whichever like dont worry tradeoffs okay questions little problem lets clear questions factorial use cursory questions okay lets apply problem solving strategy particular problem okay gonna write recursive function minutes heres goal given tree want print values stored leaf nodes okay dont want print values stored know children leaves tree want print values tree node store values stored tree ends leaves thats want print okay lets think solve problem recursively okay whats thing need mean actually start variety different ways im gonna step want print values leaf nodes tree remember theres things need solve smallest problem problem smaller combine results whats thing need yeah whats yeah whats base case know stop yeah yeah question find leafs leaf known tree defined fact children binary trees store children right reference left reference right reference left reference ive reached leaf point printer right okay base case ive reached leaf im gonna print value right problem smaller lets happen havent reached leaf node need need problem smaller right im leaf node right child left child right subtree left subtree im gonna im gonna hey dont know print know dont need print im leaf node ill ill consider right subtree left subtree separately ill okay im gonna restart algorithm print leaf nodes right subtree ill restart print leaf nodes left subtree right combining results sort right recursive algorithm needs step case whats gonna combine results output right thats gonna things work okay lets heres starting point normal tree class ive set print leaves function guys work right lets lets kind like based algorithm okay base case going okay thing need need write private wrapper function thats going actually run node similar size similar gonna functions public print leaves function going sort reflect function private version starts root okay lets following im gonna ive got children im base case right im gonna print value note alright thats base case right noise alright need ive got base case thats good place start alright start writing recursive algorithms base case theyll tend stop youll stack overflow errors seeing factorial minute ago base cases good place start recursive algorithm base case getting place good ok need yeah yeah lets lets lets let come ive got base case found leaf im gonna print leaf im gonna return right dont dont need found leaf node theres tree oh sorry alright recursive step look right left subtree work kind interesting case recursive function return value way outputs things right terminal okay ive handled base case lets line 58 im leaf node need help yeah yeah need print leaves current dot laughs thats left subtree im considering left subtree right subtree step essentially im gonna im gonna im leaf node im print leaf nodes right subtree print leaf nodes left subtree somebody pointed problem right similar talked looked size let little bit differently lets current dot left equal null left subtree lets left subtree ill thing right subtree im trying sure print leaves called null reference dont fix minute okay lets run looks like worked okay dont know particular tree leaf nodes im building tree randomly know definitely leaf node okay output run times youll ill ill ill ends leaf node okay im pretty sure correct somebody suggested check null theres couple things thats going helped problem exactly thing happened worked size tree root node null line 55 start checking dot left null reference key references blow lets check null mean current reached im leaf node im node tree ive reached end essentially tree right got know means walked tree maybe rootless point ive reached tree ive reached tree absolutely need leaf nodes tree theres print try print leaf tree air going away thing function little bit nicer rid checks im handling null explicitly values tree seven dont worry walking tree right reach tree returned alright questions dis label heres base case recursive step thats whats actually making problem smaller theres combining results like said thats happening output output display whats combining results great question question need wrapper function um mean wonder wrapper function right reason heres explanation dont want want root reference private class remember talked interfaces said interface defines public class defines class good use dont want classes poking root node tree idea whats going theyre theyll probably break right route public somebody set route null tree gone okay dont want people know root like able print leaf nodes thats wrote handy function order essentially order expose private information right provide public method called print leas takes arguments use start private method knows route okay cases kind want wrapper function right youll find like technique guys gonna tree functions write wrapper functions classes youll find places youre kind like know use recursive function im sure exactly work app adding wrapper function helps great question okay questions example maybe later right let pause talk new feature homework problems starts today homework problem today wasnt posted midnight tree recursion homework problems rest week okay havent want talk little bit means remainder week places rest semester small credit programming problem homework problems cbt f homework problems like point writing perfect code look lets hung word write perfect taking new connotations recently know code perfect sitting night like yes perfect yes perfect looked code problems detectable couple things going look going point code imperfect following ways goal way help write better code things hear time know colleagues department know auto grading guys intro classes students dont know write better code know looks know guys like fourth generation students czech style downstream instructors happy use czech style okay trust theyre like students write like unand nted stuff like know right looking ways help guys improve code write know having read dont time vein right goal goal help develop programmers computer scientists thinking things detect automatically point solution contains code called dead define terms mean intimate solution contains whats called dead code lose point thing cause lose point produced code overly complex explain means minute mean long different definition complexity got ill present okay mean dead code code dead mean dead code code reached code reached tests heres know code isnt perfect theres line code away delete correct theres line code delete function run exactly itll correct itll pass tests size guys friday right whats problem yeah thats okay thats thats problem yeah yeah okay heres thing kern equal ive returned zero line know currents know statement line code returns zero executed right dead definition standard definition way people mean dead code yeah question question waving im okay right questions pretty think pretty intuitive solution remove correct perfect right okay second piece non perfect code right im gonna returns zero detect test alright want point correct cases correct code pushing little bit higher bar right whats wrong explain mean slide says whats wrong right explain whats wrong tell code better theres way think know code wrong improve yeah yeah great great point im checking im allowed size unknown im allowed size tree thats zero know lines line 10 line 12 line 14 replaced line 14 right dont need checking right left subtree stuff like complicated code paths code return return problem little complicated code somebody reads think hard whats going happen think harder order measure essentially count number ways test suites work way code wrote thats large thats certain number solution gonna point let reassure solution like tricky solution doesnt solution solution know provided thats designed readable correct minimal like things wouldnt expect able okay solution paths imagine removed statement starts line replace line 14 reads code dont think line 12 line 10 line 14 paths code whos reading think happen thinking makes code harder understand okay questions new criteria try use places possible rest semester point youre welcome ask help point yeah points perfection cbf homework problems yeah like said points guys welcome ask help goal help write better code alright think help actually weve good conversations students past know point makes think happens code executed right identify dead code find places reduce number conditionals need order express solution youre making code better okay questions dont want spring guys undiscussed right lets problem ones fun actually expansion abilities thinking recursion right trees fun places use values trees right point weve things didnt exploit fact trees store values lets okay gonna write recursive tree search function goal return true value tree tree contains particular value want return true im going return false okay gonna okay lets talk base case yeah okay thats great point tree base case tree contain value doesnt matter value dont tell theres tree contain value right know need base case tree tree doesnt contain value case im gonna return false okay whats base case actually sorry think entire base case right yeah entire base case tree ignore slides right problem smaller right step right reach tree know doesnt contain value need look imagine im note im actually real node need look value places whats yeah left subtree right subtree contain value value left subtree right subtree okay ive got places look remember smaller im node right im trying correct left subtree fewer nodes subtree rooted right subtree notes subtree rooted gonna leave good direction okay heres whats_interesting combine results searches okay function returns boolean think recursive algorithms want think need return hints combine results size function returned integer left subtree plus right subtree plus 1 function returns boolean value somebody picked today combine results picked combine results yeah yeah perfect im gonna use logical combine results actually im going clever im gonna value left subtree value right subtree die okay cool right lets lets lets bad boy right youre saying case weve recursive function takes argument need know look right im taking argument reference object im gonna use object equality reference equality im gonna use dot equals okay right im gonna worry lets worry worry null figure gonna handle detail real lets ignore im gonna write private function called search takes value current node look im starting search lets return false im gonna wrapper method approach im gonna use public method start search root tree okay lets algorithm base case right agreed base case tree current equal null im gonna return false tree values automatically nicely gonna handle case tree doesnt content havent added nodes tree root null return false right away okay right recursive step need lets im gonna return current null current value reference im gonna current dot value dot equals value thats im saying places look chuck style gonna angry second right subtree left subtree start way current left place order think order doesnt matter gonna_talk sucker okay lets admire minute try figure actually works right base case tree fu treat entertain denotes return false look places need look look look value know value search right subtree case sorry searched left subtree right subtree okay lets hang whats angry oh okay right looks right look lets sure right thing look thats tree okay couple things lets sure finds root values root lets sure finds value thats pretty deep tree im gonna build bigger tree look value okay cool got fun let ask question look sense know guys developing intuition works brings shortcircuit evaluation sorts fun stuff right changes algorithm following okay lets instead looking look left subtree look right subtree happens value okay whats different wrote lets sure works doesnt work found gonna find gonna find going find thats integer yeah works theyre gonna find integers tree works okay whats whats different perspective best maybe thats best way think prefer ones gonna fastest effective efficient kind big difference terms yeah yeah lets think imagine im starting route okay time time root nodes actually going contain value im looking check im dont look right subtree loved subtree remember shortcircuit evaluation java means soon statement true find contain node start root find contain node dont search right subtree dont search loved subtree blue left subtree lets lets print going print currently current plus value lets look lets print value actually searching okay let search thats root right look happened looking value contained root node algorithm explored entire tree telling fact note lets lets know idea lets look ill search places look node things think convince understand theres difference good step way understand recursion questions hey search algorithm guys heard search algorithm kind cool right mean simple different family search algorithms guys sophisticated ones guys use time okay heres question weve looked little tweak makes algorithm efficient stopping allowing stop soon find value look rest tree okay guys think way search efficient yeah whats sued essence uses inorder traversal im sure thats actually gonna help cuz dont know values right imagine following gonna pick wednesday leave guys little nugget imagine im node right look code look node left subtree right subtree dont know value left subtree right subtree built tree built little bit differently knew particular node knew thing looking right subtree left subtree right pick wednesday right theres couple announcements office hours week wednesday oclock chapter coders week coders reading assignments calendar quiz right ill heads week chapter chapter seven todays quiz kind chapter 7s kind important chapter office hours wednesday hope guys fun tomorrows lab good time guys
welcome okay time talked race exciting raise dramatically expanded kinds data work computer scientist store single values work series values order kind limitations associated java arrays turns theres surprisingly large data store series values kind represent music represent text represent human genome represent know great deal recorded history species lot information whats going world didnt lot practice thats things going talk today started look new java constructs use access work data array called loop loops weve looked leave talking kind set loop certain number times havent talked know use access data race thats going today thats going naturally lead direction starting talk little bit know weve talking simple basic building blocks super important stuff mean interesting things computer science world grounded foundations theres start talking algorithms gonna introduce idea algorithm specific way solving problem algorithms ways associated computers talk computer algorithms ill usage word algorithm heavily associated computer era lot times algorithm divide design develop want run computer start talking fun monday actually start talk encapsulate algorithms unit programming logic called function lets start reviewing rape time looked lot new things today chance step kind solidify knowledge okay job array represents values zero values type unusual create job write allows series data structure example data structure takes bunch integers bunch characters structures puts order cases think book right letters need write know famous book jumble dont book anymore right makes poem makes novel makes human genome order building blocks characters human genome order organism incredibly complex mysterious strange okay arrays chance right alice work structured data java oh okay thats gonna happen weird happen okay happened arrays values order right maybe testing sort system youre going use defeat future right works right right arrays values order vat data array ive associated new piece information piece data ive added array position letter position know book poem position important positions pieces data department java syntax allows declare im gonna work data thats stored array looked know oh bug time fixed time slides today ill fix today dont right single value single integer value thats declare line wanted clear array want work multiple values use bracket notation line im telling java variable multiple going store multiple values type integer thing character variable storing character variable going store array characters havent told java want store array heres line similar single variables declaring left initializing array im saying array called multiple stores series integers int bracket notation right im initializing array store integer values nice things java arrays going come handy today know large way special notation use find elements right house array add dot special word length return number elements stored array split like variables declaration im character array line initialization im line im creating character array called line execute space store characters assign values turn away initialized syntax review time im going detail okay let remind index values array computer scientists start counting zero operate theres theres actually good reason id happy explain forum somebody asked right data actually stored computer memory works value array value index 0 heres access heres set value use bracket notation start array case good array thats slide square brackets inside im telling java index want set value array means want value heres ok kind interesting im sort features array fact length property important right im array length whats valid index array right zero second dont let trip tried access value bracket dot length cause error minute okay heres example im initializing array line 1 im declaring array called twos im initializing store powers access modify values inside array bracket notation line im printing value value stored twos going im changing im going print couple values array okay questions important try work okay look plan guys run example working okay yeah talk later okay error guys learned little bit errors today lab week error cause problem yeah yeah lets lets look happens try access value stored choose choose dot length right lets choose dot length thats gonna ill okay sorry lets try okay ive caused runtime error right array doesnt index theres lots indices doesnt couldnt know try access eighth value array thats going work guys probably start errors like start work mp zero mp checkpoint releasing today okay heres thing talking right case array size fourth indicee refers fifth value array doesnt happen talked little time want return subject java array fixed size people worked python okay yeah great python create list add stuff end add stuff beginning add stuff middle fun problem right thats actually kind cool talk later similar things java level shouldnt level deep level pipe job actually lower level language pipe sense job going expose actual limitations computer python time change size list theres actually fair work allow happen java arrays dont declare array tell java items gonna store cant change later want things array create new array copy old stuff work cant change size original right complicate programs thats java similar data structures lists exist languages like pipe talk later semester oh gave away interesting historical consequences right fixed size rates people quick poll net id ends number okay 300 starting okay right whos got higher higher higher thirty higher tell seventyfour wont ask net id guess think yeah right okay like jeffrey challenged net id challenge id fight little bit think like bumped somebody feel bad retrospect gave terrible like normal like normal identifier like guys gmail account ends number 74 maybe werent born 1974 oh met old case doesnt sense normal net id maybe memorable maybe easier share people know youre know party wants know like hi im t y pp 55 right hit later write whats whats normal way better proposal theres better ideas yeah yeah dot people gmail address looks like kind maybe right yeah like work theres theres interesting property net ids asking know netid know yeah oh antenna number end number ah okay theres lucky person hopefully like string consonants row yeah unique yeah cause lots problems right like deliver email cares ill listen right cause interesting things happen theyre unique know know theres property know guarantee yeah shorter characters thats longer characters exactly characters yeah eighth character okay learned java arrays unique property raise computer science lot languages limitation work hard people work engineering actually special program use assign net ids takes input produces terrible thing gave use right way tries things like avoiding giving people names bad words stuff like right dont succeed examples find campus people got fairly unfortunate net ids assigned right whats limit theyre characters answer question yeah yes computer program old computer program involved log email access certain accounts campus computer program designed program real person im sure probably witness protection program decided characters perfectly fine limit size username thats called arbitrary decision probably 1960s 70s living consequences today find incredibly amusing right like guys like 40 years later weird net ids programmer guys reading impact programmers world heres example decision dont know online look maybe find person right send nice note april probably probably dot com right thats probably email address theyre like im living yeah reason array program runs handles logins systems fixed size size 8 characters character net id character net id 10 character net id array fixed size know weve_got twos look forward teaching generation threes hope campus ask people hands weve tubes theyre gone right rounded guys threes clearly getting java data structures use store type information flexible fact build work race data structures end day store data array work limitation time theres clever ways talk month talked time loops arrays hand hand designing computer programs data array frequently want want array item time maybe music array sample want like modify sample know auto tune right know adjust pitch higher lower programs work maybe data array picture little individual components photo want want sort filtering look beautiful background look professional right like cool little tools guys disposal snapchat instagram guys online heres heres sorry im getting excited getting ahead heres sort canonical way items array right array declared online called primes array seven values primes loop heres set loop talked 99 loops write going loops 99 loops maybe 95 gonna look exactly like okay array right want want element maybe want find ones greater value remove maybe want modify maybe want print like im okay heres looks loop index variable loop started zero run length array thats valid index array update loop increment 1 time loop runs 0 ill print value primes second time runs 1 ill print second value primes time runs value think little bit time runs fine valid index array values ill print prime 13 ill java actually slightly easier way known enhanced loop think java enhanced loop 90s term heres essentially write loop like loop look minute different syntax loop lets slow look array array called primes array integers values ive initialized store prime numbers 2 3 5 7 11 13 initialize index variable use index variable access values inside array im gonna declare variable thats going receive iteration loop value data stored primes youll note theres index okay advantage enhanced loop little bit cleaner disadvantage dont access index dont actually know index value im looking depending youre loop problem looking solution code np checkpoint theres places use enhanced loop theres places cant actually need know index index piece data youre looking iteration okay way alright gonna examples questions art playground time good yeah yep yeah thats great important distinction use enhanced forloop prime doesnt index gets value time runs prime thats value array second time runs set time runs set set zero yeah stores data inside loop great question okay question people know little bit python whats difference list array come talk lists like said thats actually fun parts semester gonna build couple lists java youre gonna actually implemented ways implement list like array list test couple extra features list add items add item end add item beginning insert item list requires changing size cant array right lets typically features like remove elements right things like list ways generalization array like array stores series values allows modify place array actually allows modify size rate let try perform operations modify size cant im right accept answer awesome okay yeah come talk lists great example build data structure yeah raise faster certain cases yeah question lets advantage array theres talk implement lists yeah arrays advantages theyre dont exist know couldnt better questions yeah zero index zero array value yes called zero indexing start learn think start counting zero yeah yeah yeah question ran code question answer loops print values run like minute yeah ones efficient think identical yeah loops suspect equivalent yeah yeah biggest tradeoff know things programmer right creative activity guys making tradeoffs right right way things thats interesting youre writing code right ways things spend lot time start write complex pieces code youre thinking worrying decisions like best possible way gonna regret minutes right minutes im like oh regretting im gonna fix right pixie things right heres tradeoff right pro enhanced forloop little cleaner right syntax little nicer con dont access index right dont know value im looking thing regular regular access index con remember index array place right rid brackets right brackets thats nice dont know yes nest arrays talk week yes job multidimensional arrays obviously theyre useful storing sorts data thing want remind remember array interesting data structure partly maps directly whats actually happening computer okay computer stores huge array numbers photo right photo looks twodimensional computer single stream numbers movie movie dimension alright thats time dimension computer single stream work data presented human higher dimension programming language called flattening order actually store interview dont worry program work like dimensional dimensional dimension dimensional want internally stored single series eyes great great question im glad yeah yep ah question valid index primes dot like minus 1 loop contain constraint answer question whats yep yeah write equal prime stock length minus 1 typically want point worked exactly way loop able write sleep right end semester probably send cbt ill blindfold tell ive got array called foo write loop know suggest write way right sort dont know somebody decision little cleaner right learn recognize loop goes value array pattern right questions right lets play lets play examples ok oh wait want point guys good stop time time little bit encouragement right want point years class im definitely gonna pitch guys years class right like thats natural thing right got 94 quiz particularly hard quiz right guys know pretty spring 92 92 points fall thats probably ok right gonna suffer guys right guys cbt op know lot real assessment college hope went homework keeping things guys class trust seen hundreds students probably thousands students succeed course guys right lets loops okay lets lets write want print character print lets print separate lines lets use prep okay start approaching problems like useful slow think little bit need right okay talk tell little bit needs happen dont write code describing sentence im going accomplish yeah yeah yeah im gonna im gonna loop array thats element im gonna print elements ways use lets normal loop know things im gonna semester im gonna try guys sense sort work problems like right like loop know point write sleep lot times youre writing loop thing want set loop youll ive written loop ive initialized index like place code allowed use variable single letter know loop traditional loop inside loop use j loop inside loop inside loop use k loops come talk somethings wrong yeah use index place allow away single letter okay ive got loop actually know im getting started lets simpler lets print want sure code actually like going value index properly okay youre writing code stop dry things right dont try write write smallest possible piece figure sure works point know loop operating properly array values print index zero okay know loop right need adjust whats inside im going use variable indicee print alright questions guys guys know computers fantastic condorcets right like theyre interactive right use advantage biggest mistakes particularly people work know larger pieces code like machine project guys gonna start today biggest mistakes people try understanding code right smallest possible piece work add little bit work add little bit work use print statements figure whats going thats good way finding program oh lets okay lets write inherence place okay im gonna need change loop lets current letter print letter like look examples right know forget like whats syntax enhanced forloop ill ill find little piece code online theyre like oh right okay thats right got know colon know heres heres initialization right ive got variable type ive got array ive got colon okay thats thats need okay lets try thing great right im gonna leave exercise reader figure different way write okay lets lets fun lets lets lets loop backwards okay thing im going suggest cant enhanced loop goes forwards thats going backwards kind unusual lets lets figure lets write original loop great chance guys write loop heres wrote instant ago work okay ive got going forwards need change backwards yeah right starts actually lets lets print figure indices right bracket notation im going 0 1 2 3 want backwards start yeah bingo yeah starts valid index array print dot length minus 1 okay update time run im gonna trouble actually think run gonna lets happens yeah run town prints 1 okay clearly work im starting right spot right need change yeah yeah ive got okay im gonna trouble right run uhoh okay started right youll got right answer didnt know gonna stop right zero want stop loop stop yeah yeah typically condition long greater equal zero continue thats greater equal zero valid index im assuming started right spot im good okay lets replace right okay good right think im gonna leave exercise reader run okay ah little bit different challenge know far weve printing stuff right okay tricky right heres proposal lets start printing values im gonna write enhanced forloop thats gonna print value array doubt start know okay know write enhance loop prints values okay need change want sum okay answer im going im terrible 150 okay thing think want able print sum im gonna value mean calculating loop finishes need able print sum need declare variable thats gonna store sum declare inside loop yeah example know whats called accumulator variable outside loop okay whats type variable need use store sum array event story doubles use double case im going use end im going sum equal zero im gonna start zero asked start adding numbers start zero right start okay lets print sum lets fill piece code okay im probably values sum zero finish close inside loop value sum iteration finishes value 20 sun 30 modifying sum time yeah essentially im saying son bigger im looking im gonna sum equal sum plus current way simplify sec okay lets print current sum way talk string talk plus operator dos string case gonna print strings separated space okay write little bit lets happened okay time current value 10 son 30 second time current value 20 sum sorry hurt 10 sum 10 added youll sum increasing time right im correct awesome im gonna final model clean little cleanup modifications im gonna rid print statement got right answer wanted somebody pointed theres slightly clever way use plus equals operator exactly code common thing im taking value im increasing im saying time add value current sum sure works good questions okay example writing called algorithm topic going consume large rest semester mean continue come level deep conceptual heart computer science reason learn program computer implement algorithms program things happen youll better programmer reason reason youll want algorithms able use sophisticated look upload picture photo sharing site recognizes theres picture cat photo thats algorithm selfdriving car semi autonomous vehicle small decisions adjust steering stays lane thats algorithm know reach students class little bit algorithm identify lives organized judged apply job algorithm thats going run pass resume try credit card theres algorithm decide deserve credit card credit given buy things algorithms decide legitimate purchase likely suddenly bought know nights resort bahamas conceptual heart computer scientist whats exciting appeal way algorithms implemented entirely simple building blocks weve discussed past weeks know performing simple calculations making decisions know storing results making simple decisions things thats leads array data thats photo label cat complicated sophisticated large number calculations end day simple bring frustrated im end day computer calculator runs fast okay try fool want rarely want deterministic thing right end day running simple things said computer algorithm word algorithm heavily associated computer era things computers actually mining text data learn words history things find heres word usage heres usage word algorithm mining bunch texts collected years digitized know digital book products projects algorithm start taking 1960 happening time computers alright alright simple weeks going implementing algorithms simple algorithms gonna_talk know going struggle long time things hear students time class know know solve problem cant code thats gonna problems gonna solve hard getting computer struggle youre getting started okay right im gonna let pick actually know hold lets time okay lets numbers want maximum algorithm solving problem whats algorithm algorithm series steps able write computer able person able follow carefully arrive correct result okay ive got numbers whats way figure biggest yeah thats im gonna build algorithm know describe algorithm neat want hear english want talk steps yeah way yeah youre good start right clearly compare numbers right lets start okay thats numbers way eliminate numbers yeah lets lets lets imagine lets pick test largest order largest true number lets bigger numbers right okay lets lets b c ill ill compare b bigger b c know largest number know largest number okay took compared b c bigger im winner numbers left compare cant biggest look b c pick compare bigger c b bigger c maximum whats maximum value c series steps actually number numbers right im going determine largest comparing numbers im largest dont think problem smaller compared second leave guys important announcement right process releasing mp0 fact im going like right talking right thatll website minute big moment class want minute talk whats happen lives im kidding havent seen like youre gonna check youre gonna know excited start hope hope actually advantage office hours weekend going right weeks finish checkpoint gonna code brains going explode okay lot complicated frightening youve seen stuff normal okay homework problems class little bitesized pieces designed feel comfortable build slowly surely machine project big gnarly piece stuff thats designed feel uncomfortable harder checkpoint astonished little code wrote okay like 20 lines total night frustrated digging searching define needed normal class mps intimidating started dont freak come office hours ask help forum guys trust exciting beginning journey gonna couple months right gonna little help lab week started weekend office hours today office hours saturday sunday okay thing wanted important chance talk minute okay noticed syllabus new semester np deadlines half people labs start 3 raise hand okay guys cant remember names groups guys blue year think sunday deadlines machine project people labs start 300 later right youre orange group monday deadlines til end semester okay calm lets talk im gonna explain number reason choice im happy talk forum im happy talk reddit right number reason choice provide better support office hours crowded deadline time dividing half means everybody going help need im happy explain im happy discuss implications things going work december right probably monday fact certainly monday family business attend think post video lecture ben probably guys week enjoy mp great
okay right welcome promise im working fixing new hardware arriving think guys come sit guys fraud wifi pretty hard takes minutes things stabilize sorry welcome today gonna theres lot new content today couple things talk kind clarifications additions knowledge know things weve presented gonna thats fun exciting gonna work problems thats kind whats gonna consume second half class things talk clarifications little bit additional information couple things weve working need explain little better couple problems practice right sort goal rest semester getting point think class layers getting point kind like layer information guys need know start talking objects week guys start refer imperative programming thats weve basic building blocks oh okay basic building blocks computer programs gonna start second unit class gonna continue work developing problemsolving skills going start include introduce new tools objects new way structuring data half class actually start diving deeper algorithms data structures essentially stuff youve seen far gonna practicing rest semester youre little bit youre struggling little bit homework problems cbt f quizzes thats ok stuff doesnt away foundation build talked class right problems want talk little bit functions technically monday actually start want moment people end week class hope people okay know maybe end week college kind exciting enemy general concerns questions want ask know getting point mp starting np0 starting heat awesome lot people working great office hours today weekend office hours weekend obviously important want ask concerns yeah official mp grader depends lot free time sunday night monday night im working close weve decided reason rebuild class semester finished apologize let clear mp grader performs operation perform locally grade mp run grade intellij configuration hit shield plugin youve installed thats exactly grade assignment official thing know copy test suites stuff like sure havent changes example going grade assignment youve taken test cases returned know pass right couple things submission sure trust run great task havent changes test suites youre running great task locally exactly thing run efficiently important want confidence submit youre gonna scored think let point auto grader running like fleet machines disposal particularly deadline times stuff backs little bit right wait half hour hour official score submission need point trust vocal greater order allow like said officially grade assignment theres tricks dont hidden test suites dont differently essentially run tool know intellij installation thing score like got 40 got 40 long didnt monkey test suites weird right goal giving grater piece build built version built original version couple years ago allow confidence submission right dont want submitting find score youre gonna tell long havent weird score efficiently great question yep eventually greater works push minutes longer depending push submissions grade youll official grade grades page yeah absolutely working decided break semester working working lot better guys wont notice know care stuff works having maintain stuff care works changes making going help yeah submit times want look semester prevent practicing promise thats commitment dont loose credit homework problems dont lose credit mp4 multiple_times grade single commit push best score commits okay penalty trying right thats learned dont im gonna penalize point run time okay im giving infinite time complete need track right need moving forward yeah theres penalty push good question question stretch russian yeah visualization like video showing like video yeah question visualization game works ill ill ask ben wants right dont know saw mpc instructions want build fully working version game right code change configuration file weve given solutions compiled obfuscated form cant use figure np weve given essentially solution np thats included want fully working want youre gonna months build right good idea ask ben wants sort screencast sense game supposed work youre yeah yep semester youre working project thanksgiving yeah weve broken specific pieces know weekend weekend guys checkpoint release second checkpoint thatll things work right yes basically going finn youre going completing app stages right course months thats actually know hope guys appreciate allows cool things staff pointed like oh like functions guys writing terrible like arguments theyre gross know reason havent taught use objects think youre actually gonna rewrite code use objects youll cleaner nicer dont know thing work array doubles represents latitudes right guys objects help simplify parts mp teach later mp check actually neat thing working project long period time know future youre software developer find new im rewrite parts code im working reflect new knowledge right doesnt stop mp checkpoints okay questions yeah nope nope weve recorded pushes havent yeah know im gonna im gonna prediction mess times right time run grade wrong run rerun know pushed know pushed point future correct grade motion right long push deadline noted know submitted code dont need worry pushing gun late yeah good question questions great okay lets talk functions monday talked functions things ben told nice semester away things ben told functions couldnt turns true know went ive liked article know years old know warning sides bad professor right professor boring dont consider boring knows im im turning lights guys sleeping professors bummed doesnt syllabus professor assigns undoable work guilty petty rules cant fill class period know rambling running music minutes class thats problem theres theres like lies right probably list like professor deano directly lies heres example told functions couldnt signature heres example case run code theres snippet code im declaring functions like weve past ignore static keyword thats going sense minutes right declared functions line ive declared function called sum function takes arguments integers returns sum return type int function open parentheses list arguments separated commas argument looks like variable declaration type says pass integers ill return sum spot function called sum okay takes arguments arguments case doubles returns double turns use piece code case im adding int second case im adding doubles know think maybe second overrides like right let thats case comment second function im gonna error right error produced talk happening minute air produced need second sum function defy code work problem whats happening thing wonder know saying need function use code functions named sum right think java tells apart functions different yeah okay thats thats question return type right returns int returns double turns thats okay lets lets experiment hypothesis lets im gonna return int ill explain second oh doesnt like okay let try okay ill explain minute im want messing right turns functions work return type great hypothesis doesnt look like correct lets print convince fact running okay good bought correct whats happening yeah type arguments ah okay okay hypothesis declare multiple functions long arguments different lets experiment hypothesis lets declare lets change second sum function intz happens okay error compiler saying ive defined method called sum actually interesting look compiler identifies method says method sum doesnt use includes argument types essentially java compiler complaining ive defined method called sum takes integers arguments java define function java actually uses whats called method signature identify try use method signature contains arguments types number arguments types want different lets want second sum function takes sand returns end different distinguish takes int yeah change thats true right sump right different problem let rid guy right okay works im calling right wanted use yeah add argument parameter yeah lets lets remove casts gonna_talk seconds plus second plus sum functions sums arguments second sums yeah combination function arguments number arguments types different order java figure want use code runs actually compiles happens java says okay youre calling function named sum function named sum takes arguments integers okay know told function existed implemented know thing okay youre calling function sum takes integer arguments told function know okay thats known method overloading turns come mention later turns connected powerful interesting feature java programming language okay gonna kind talk use actually type polymorphism right later big scary word talk talk objects java uses function list argument types determine function combining refer function signature remove function force compiler print error message youll example function signature right function signature sum types arguments java doesnt care doesnt help example change parameters problem right names right types job change parameter double work added parameter work right example method signature okay awesome java figures function looks function right looks function accepts parameters im passing right needs arguments right order right types okay right java type conversion try find match long theres loss precision mean lets come talk minute actually gonna_talk right apparently okay run code sums instance sums doubles removed functions careful remove let lets remove sums intz right works huh interesting whats going looks like line 11 im calling function called integers arguments double happening happening remember remember remember let jog memory little bit remember double d equal 10 works fine 10 d double yeah yeah theres information thats lost cant opposite cant int cant type int cant int add save double value opposite long theres loss information java convert things integer value cast automatically double gonna cast things loss precision loss information minute okay happens function line 12 thing java says know function called takes integers arguments answer defined function commented function goes process trying figure okay know integer use double im losing information lets try lets try use double function called sum takes know combination types convert eventually finds theres function called double takes sorrysorry takes doubles converts integers doubles theres integers cant save floating point component theres loss information calls function sum print statement result double okay right lets start talk know guys gonna gonna come handy upcoming homework problems mp let talk know rule sort design pattern best practice write particular piece code type code things write function pretty rest semester homework problems np gonna consist completing functions youre check point couple functions functions need work okay start implementing function things useful try figure theres problems arguments youve passed input validation parameter validation example wanted function summed numbers array im passing array numbers things want start work actually start implementing algorithm check sure numbers saying okay theres theres problem arrays java im gonna second right lets lets lets okay heres wrong lets skip okay dont know ill im gonna implement sum function im gonna yous enhanced forloop value number ill return okay lets works print win sum oh need int alright im gonna create ray inch right works okay feel like im feeling good feel like im right heres problem input function cause crash im gonna tell input minute way evil person guys finding chapter encoders bugs like know user didnt understand wanted right somebody know wrong input text yes phone number email address right asked email address died computer code know like knows right people strange things let special actually think somebody asks ago like whats value uninitialized array initialize array value java special value called wish mean entire class talking fascinating topic guys google find sorts articles people refer java billion dollar mistake caused problems software value value means doesnt exist ill causes problems minute job special literal value called null start talking objects lets little bit sense essentially means object reference doesnt refer ive declared array havent new keyword create array array variable refers doesnt exist like points okay special value java like encourage slide cant justice interesting right know languages weve started use lot develop tools class language notice column collins big design principles null safety tries code safe problems involving special value weird null absence stuff turns deep implications code okay valid object array properties methods attempt going fail fail spectacularly okay attempts use know going result runtime crash terrible means app means deploy app app store play store people know fun app stopped working like thats message good okay right lets lets im gonna happens right lets know im user want world burn boom created problem crashed coat know know hope happens run chest opposed youre know silicon valley pitching vc showing brand new know cool app crashes good ok fact theres input use crash code good want called input validation im going problem oh doesnt like ok right know problem know ive crashed program right lets new int 0 fine right little strange im gonna rid doesnt sense like zero thats ok want understand java distinguish array thats special null value refers array doesnt exist ok causes crash okay okay second minute run yeah fine right think uninitialized value array going think zero oh guys hopeful hopeful like nope oh mad okay initialize right turns certain cases start creating objects dont initialize array known default value array type object java thats biggest problems value jump okay lets example going fix want sure code crash yeah yeah lets lets try null value use conditional statement check numbers equal numbers special array hasnt initialized heres good question whats sum array elements think zero pretty okay thing end semester start talking errors java actually good place generate error function called null array like called function messed let know mistake meantime know lets return zero like reasonable value okay oh dont im good heres pattern start write complicated functions complicated general pattern check inputs sure theyre saying know numbers null cant iterate doesnt matter use enhanced loop normal cant array know know okay want check things like example array code works array pass array lets okay coming guy pass array gonna work fine thats okay goes loop wanted handle number equal null numbers dot length equal 0 return 0 ah okay actually weve seen fun examples power java evaluates conditional expressions question okay know general tight like try let let fun lets direction okay numbers dot length equal zero numbers equal null im gonna try value oh problem remember talked shortcircuit evaluation safe rid end isnt gonna crash reason java evaluates conditional expression numbers going evaluate right ill null pointer exception im gonna try length time right conditional expression know numbers known length problem array length problem example shortcircuit evaluation coming handy promised okay great lets finish okay places unfortunately java programming language shows age little bit heres im going teach feel little conflicted heres im gonna teach class going use fancy advanced methods avoiding null java exist okay going use going use consciously right know theyre think point computer history useful guys feeling work null world haunting found better ways work use programming languages like rust haskell kotlin know modern programming languages bunch ways avoid having deal problem java problem okay im gonna teach defensive function write value pass value expected sure code crash sensible normally tell value particularly homework itll suchandsuch parameter null following thing tell need implement defensive logic person talking definitely hear thank talk quieter alright lets talk know people ill quickly okay want force talked fact job automatically convert doubles losing information wont automatically convert double int theres fractional component wont preserved times want know comes certain places im gonna quick right want force java conversion lose information use whats called explicit cast explicit type cast example line im declaring variable called id anti initialize set double value information lost okay cant try set value double compiler complain wont gonna hold need tell know youre way heres typecast youll type inside parenthesis tells java know im boss know im let double value convert end gonna happen look lets play examples right okay youll line fails pull line good ill print result know happened right force okay guys think works think java rounds yeah yeah lets lets find lets lets perform experiment okay im gonna rid im gonna use literal lets try point okay oh oh right okay longer int lets yeah happens decimal discarded java round functions job round cast tosses decimal point says hey told want right goes right lets couple problems quickly dont time liked couple announcements interspersed maybe actually cuz theyre kind important come sec okay like said course works layers believe actually week guys quiz week midterm quiz following week right particularly background know python little bit programming experience heres whats gonna happen like youre gonna okay couple weeks youre gonna quizzes like oh gosh suddenly got hard beginners right theyve work day going catch surprise right know said difficulty level quizzes id probably goes hits midterm comes little bit start objects sort like sawtooth function keeps going right start suckit unit course start talking objects things little simpler couple weeks weeks quiz midterm hard know let tell prepare quizzes hard lecture slides lecture slides source information multiple choice questions multiple choice questions ask drawn directly class theyre tricks appeared slide okay hoenn 25 practice problem set old homework problems old quiz questions ill start release old quiz questions couple people havent taken couple quizzes system probably week definitely midterm old quiz programming questions available practice best way programming questions gonna write multiple choice questions like know fine right worth points programming questions small problem slow general piece advice dont stuck know ive people like got jammed programming problems lost points couldnt like couldnt finish felt like close kept spinning like know thirty minutes went ran time dont right stuck problem right away right away come youre stuck maybe fresh set eyes problem went away youll time left bang problem right dont stuck okay yeah great little algorithm pseudocode guys want figure okay lets oh okay thing want talk quickly consider generous dropped grade policy class syllabus course component machine project number drop grade drop like homework problems classes labs quizzes cant drop midterms thats component drop okay dont think people misunderstand youre sports team need miss class thats youve got home funeral thats youve got sick couldnt attend class thats arent like skip class happens causes miss class need drops thats works everybody drops result dont exceptions im gonna excuse absence class dont come youll consume drops know gonna use drops cuz got sick week im sorry sucks sick middle semester gonna semester stopped coming class week didnt sick know know life isnt fair way right allows core staff deal gives lot time things beneficial everybody okay contact missing class im gonna send link syllabus says dont contact missing class know policy youre gonna use absence right covered right miss class im worried ability succeed class thats drops calibrated achieve result okay dont email know know guys gonna use thats okay getting doesnt time know general fine dont cant come class dont expect try understand external forces intervene okay im time unfortunately guys want problems lets start conversation forum reminder mp checkpoint weekend deadline day thats sunday monday depending group youre office hours today sibo office sorry seven oh 403 ill office 100 300 great weekend
right welcome everybody welcome friday nice end week okay today gonna continue talking objects topics introduce today stickier conceptual bits gonna learn objects semester bear concept key word causes people lot problems lot confusion think introducing making sure understand actually going end understanding objects wouldnt necessarily understand perfectly didnt understand static thats gonna okay apologize time slide playground running work fine today result ill slow times today examples carefully know didnt play things time reminder point forward gonna run loose code loose methods defined outside class examples like going run theyre gonna start executing main method defined example class okay dont class example going angry main method going gonna fail stick loose code going compile okay similar java actually works sort taking away training wheels month allowed write imperative code easily dealing objects end todays lecture youre actually going understand pretty know static main method right little bit mysterious run examples start running main method thats defined example class classes dont particular order usually example think find normally define classes working experimenting example class main method contain code want run okay awesome thing want guys midterm congratulations little round applause thats actually good score know coming places like got 85 felt bad dont know good number compares prior classes monday gonna_talk little bit midterm im gonna kind questions talk interpret score entirely diagnostic tool punishment angry assess standing progress course know midterm result thats going indicate know things going great need tweak couple things people concerns know ill right maybe start chew weekend care exam programming questions bombed multiplechoice im little confused okay programming questions able programming questions confident bomb multiplechoice questions im little confused thats possible im cool know able programming problems midterm concerned future class thats kind baseline establishing gonna build forward thats kind imperative code need able write work objectoriented concepts gonna come month okay talk monday overall satisfied performance class questions term exam point yeah yeah question release programming questions midterm answer yes need doublecheck sure everybodys taken assuming thats case probably week whats yeah absolutely mean want guys practice okay good lets wednesday weve started learn design types java programming language point weve working primitive types theyre limited dont allow store information javas builtin features clever idea said look dont know different kinds data people going want work future addition giving starting points building blocks primitive types intz longs characters going object system allows create types represent pieces information data objects want draw connection strongly dont think objects data object system java define class youre establishing new kind data work program case im defining person class age thats sort canonical examples later pick want work program example kind design class brings pieces information thing need store order work program alright time start added classes kind exciting ability hide information ability control access pieces data class class declaration person class telling java im going create new type language called person thats gonna store suggests information person ive classes review combined state behavior data algorithms instance class stores data specify provides methods use access data useful things ive got person class ive decided person going age time introduced public private access modifiers java keywords allow restrict access parts class apply variables needed methods looked public private probably useful public variable lets start variable public variable accessed anybody anybody directly set retrieve value variable things left time things told thats interesting evolved java programming language uncommon public variable class normally different town im showing understand want create private variables private variable doesnt mean variables inaccessible wouldnt useful instead means methods define class methods associate class access variable methods read write public anybody modify anybody retrieve private methods defined class modify retrieve value okay function access modifiers public private work similarly apply keywords method means public anybody private called methods class important heres way think youre designing class particularly youre designing methods class talk interfaces couple weeks thats kind neat topic comes naturally start talk objects things youre youre determining people class mark method public anybody expect people mark method public probably need explain people use add documentation java doc right look documentation example string class youre_seeing information generated java doc comments actually code private method hand different class person use youre designing class methods stuff like dont worry somebody method didnt write code right maybe friends working project maybe youre gonna publish library people use mark method private invisible outside group guys use means lot times dont provide documentation know private right thats useful right java access modifiers actually visible things dont like java ok theres called protected cover point talk packages organizational concept software comes java dont talk theres called packaged private whats confusing java ok let let point let playground ok things thats confusing java default setting wonder happens lets let different find different example okay lets public string right create person havent rubber default constructor doesnt set fields im expecting person dot novel hmm oh ive got things backwards ive writing lot collin recently course developers teasing said youre gonna start messing lecture collin type reverse mistake try right lets set lets print sure 14 way expect marked public okay good dont mark omit access modifier works reason omit access modifier default called package private ways package private fool thinking public works lot way public gave piece code somebody longer able set reason main set included package working group classes bundled okay little bit confusing theres explicit package private modifier theres like package private doesnt exist okay omit access modifier thats okay great lets talk getters etc point isnt interesting okay interesting example evolution programming language alright java comes man java come michael look tease cross fingers okay thing remember java came like weeks javascript interesting java comes feature says variables public know level like useful thing anybody modify value variable okay ive got access modifier variables uses anymore considered bad chucks file yell mark class instance variables public instead create private instance variable public age package private int age instead create private variable called age create special functions know mechanical syntax like said theres feature intellij generate code boilerplate people joke java java programmer like paid line code lot code write like formulaic right like okay imagine write piece code write code thats intellij okay ive got private variable ive got functions function called set age function called age setter getter set age takes argument thats type variable case int sets variable pass modify variable age returns type variable takes arguments returns value variable notice variable private functions public essentially ive allowing anybody set value age director instead im forcing functions set age age canonical java community everybody things right languages appeared java java like actually okay essentially mark variables public like im java programmer im paid line code like line code public int age ive got seven ive multiplied payout seven right accomplishes okay equivalent having public variable couldnt turns interesting right kind fun observation design patter unlocks sorts cool stuff sort dramatically changed semantics variables class ive got bunch new stuff example right equivalent having public variable theres sorts new things example new things hasnt contributed today yeah yeah time set age youre running code wrote setter example validate age passed actually works age right negative age doesnt sense maybe pass negative age im gonna maybe wont change age figure said set invalid value later semester talk exceptions things thatll cause person mistake realize air okay validate inputs thats good yeah yeah yeah auditing example lets want track times age person changed right gets code create counter thats associated time function called incremental counter actually create read sort interesting right java public private public anybody modify retrieve private modify retrieve want read variable set constructor modified accomplish pattern lets dont want variable read write write dont provide setter away center change value variable retrieve times thats easy okay design pattern know code got small uh look sorts sorts things right heres example right heres example single setter multiple getters retrieve pieces information kind extract variable heres person know know know deal data course realize guys sorts weird names im right im like weird parts hanging understand lets pretend dividing simple finding white space splitting parts know true okay gonna look setter modify actually changed variables class changed gets passed passed work right code split court law white space thats second heres heres example essentially variables class retrieve set set variables automatically populated lets lets look example okay lets design class going use store certain number integers okay storage class ive created ive gotten started saying okay know need store certain number integers im gonna create im gonna declare class instance class variable thats array thats im gonna store integers provide okay im going provide set method thats gonna allow modify integers stored storage class think like kind similar array thats okay add things okay whats thing need okay class design exercise day thats thing need yeah yeah yeah need constructor actually thats great point couple different ways constructor takes array sets array array populates values lots things simpler definitely want constructor right minimum constructor need know class created yeah number elements im going store okay lets create constructor right remember create constructor named class im gonna variable called size im gonna im gonna use storage equal new int size okay wrong yeah yeah happens size negative number kind crash crash code good lets storage theres equal new storage okay obviously cant anymore notice ive created constructor cant use constructor good okay lets sure works value makes sense lets try pass bad value ive got runtime error thats created negative array size exception good okay solve problem guys dont tools solve problem correctly come like month ill new tool toolbox know right thing problem constructor cant fail lets pass negative number kind work yeah check size zero okay size zero theres theres options suggest definitely dont want create array negative size thats working yeah print error message yeah pro heres problem constructors return value yeah yeah create storage object reasonable mean messed heres im gonna im gonna storage object super unuseful im going print error message like idea im gonna tell lets system dot error print print system dot error ill print size value okay didnt crash okay thats good right thing terrible right thing mind work code playground error messages kind useful youre like working android app system dot dot print lin know goes output logs app know doesnt read user yeah like ways communicate user writing output going seen good okay right good lets right wanted store integers okay need class isnt interesting need need add methods like ive created array initially ideally id like able mean kind making acted little bit like array kind like safer version array need super exciting yeah need like able yeah lets like element array array acting lot like like array right yeah okay lets write lets write lets write method gonna return int mmm good okay im gonna write sort getter little complicated gutters weve seen far lets want retrieve particular value array need know need know index lets index return storage index okay thats gonna work time 0 lets print value okay knows gonna print whats default havent set values array default value ana reyes initialize int food array value set array whats inside array int whats default value int zero yeah youre close hadnt initialized array constructor youd right yeah right zero good okay lets okay ive got problem stick negative value good okay like avoid problem remember like im trying like safer version array meaning dont want happen dont need code use array problems avoid cant avoid right happen know guys know answer question hasnt contributed today yeah yeah ive got code right thats running right know value index youre sending lets return zero know youre giving bad index index zero cant return value array return instead im like dont know places theres right answer ill return negative okay bogus negative indices im good okay perfectly safe okay ive got problem array im checking zero need greater equal size array bad value know lets print statement know bad okay right kind cool guess like safer array theres problem whats wrong whats wrong code wrong useful id like able far function return zeros exciting need able creating storage class yeah yeah wont able set values array lets write sutter okay code going similar im going set set index need value lets explicitly mark public right said code looks lot like code checks index theres problem dont want return negative void function ill return check value sure youre giving bogus value check index youre giving bad index good lets try dot set lets grab value okay good liked lets fun quickly like idea earlier constructor kind exciting lets right lets create constructor allows provide array work problem going sense talk object references week problem point array array passed sharing content dont want instead want copy array lets instead lets storage array equal new array thats size provide im gonna im gonna array passed im gonna storage equal values array copy create initialize array size gave line 12 loop starts line 13 goes values prints lets sure works new int 1 2 5 need change oh yeah textile doesnt like okay ditch alized erase ball questions kind fun know wouldnt canonical example setter getter im actually setting getting array value class right lets actually lets lets quickly lets example lets person example let rid code ill im gonna fast example kind canonical way set class like public string okay right dont yeah way set value youve created yeah private access example creating read variable providing setter wanted allow set create method returns void called set takes ah right use function set yeah right questions centers gutters okay actually lets lets want drive home important concept objects thats difficult wrap head started object state man lets print right cool happened created person person object line 15 initialized created person object line 16 initialized modified person created variable called got printed dot dot change thats thats separate object think similar questions access modifiers setters gutters start process confusing minutes weekend right making sense hope yes class b private thats great question okay class b private answer outer talk later weve working far small digression called outer class outer class inside class outer classes public create java called inner class come talk later im trying scare guys weekend thatll work thats valid java code classes stick inside classes pry outer classes questions right lets talk oops sorry right ones inside private public come talk dont want far otterbox okay game java keyword bingo cross static gonna_talk keyword java bring fair trepidation talk monday static feel like causes confusion concept objectoriented programming course okay mark static methods marked static variables marked static mean point variables methods weve working variables example look look example separate variables stored separately theyre accessed separately theyre modified separately stick static variable method longer belongs object instead belongs class okay mean instance variable practical perspective okay example new syntax think right marked method print static point instance method didnt instance class instance class order method im relaxing restriction right long class method actually work method class followed method static methods method instance object example line 11 ive created new instance type course class course static method instance dont need instance ok point way try instance method instance object fails thats called instance method class method static method called class alright static method called directly class called instance heres thats important particular type method called instance class cant use keyword remember refers instance class thats running method static method theres instance class necessarily example instance variable know come monday want guys look think weekend confusing reasons confusing brief aside static thing java makes huge difference things work small keyword know letters wrong spot stop working rid start working ok instance variable dont use static variable instance object instance class copy variable course method static theres copy run class cant access method instance couldnt use dot static variables static method static methods typically useful im going static barrier static variable instance class shares variable changes visible instances access instance class create courses increment counter course count access course class static variable print count access variable statements going print okay let prove right good right heres heres confusing wont work right change static non static cant access way line 15 lets imagine im track like suggested course instances created thats kind nice time constructor increment counter counter shared instance course heres places doesnt work anymore instance variable im increased 0 1 static class variable let sure explicitly print statement ill rid create course value count create courses value right pick monday hope ive confused enjoy weekend quick announcement wanted like interview la sclass like im gonna today 200 office office hours want dont youre 200 im going repetitive great weekend guys
right welcome everybody happy friday getting case weather aware getting cold today like guy im ready want home change shorts cool temperatures today gonna today fun warm goal today connect talked monday talked wednesday im hoping know pleasures teaching class like couple times start realize know deficiencies youve dont tell cas think know 125 perfect class handed directly mind god like things past happen explained things relationship java references polymorphism actually allows concepts sense thats goal gonna little bit review start set scene talk little bit polymorphism little bit specific talked know gonna stop wiesel worlds like objects morph kinds objects doesnt sense instead gonna accurate object particular type reference object type super types way refer object implications try tease okay monday talked fact know goes little bit inheritance review java class extends class capital l object ultimate parent ancestor java class new types add javas type system class declaration syntax inherits dont explicitly extend class implicitly extend object objects object java extends object example particular subset java class hierarchy organized idea things general talk end class talked polymer physics idea object supposed contain capabilities java wants single object type system example string thats provided object want useful able print type java object debugging purposes theres couple methods inherit captulo object equality class expected notion equality means instances class equal thats need assign class provide right object general stuff tree whats happened things getting specific breaking things smaller smaller categories theres subset java objects think representing characters thats pretty small subset actually theres lots different types java objects guys working machine project characters theyve got different types data different types entities represent computer programs characters tiny tiny little subset ok going know level tree talking specific set things characters divisions theres different kinds characters im dividing digits letters right imagine different characters different capabilities example character certain type capability digits letters different ones sum divide letters vowels consonants youre talking particular language system language systems different subdivisions going tree know breaking things smaller smaller categories javas classes categorical object objects characters right like string right objects strings okay characters digits letters according diagram options exhaustive need classes letters digits vowels consonants fully exhausted splitting things smaller smaller categories im gonna come talk city class thing want guys notice know object talking putting category means understand right took character determine vowel consonant mother knots letter digit requires knowing character obtaining information object working working smaller smaller subset overall object tree tiny fraction java objects characters fraction characters considered consonants consonants represent tiny fraction java objects gain information specific game generality lose information object level dont know java object character stray pet main activity classes guys create mp knows know couple things string hash code equals theres methods okay reminder im gonna quickly dont extend extend object extends object theres small number methods object java object system going said methods work kind java object type data think working type know entity program want represent java class features object extremely gentle okay able support certain things objects come talked interfaces look certain things java objects dont provide class support right things java objects things able java object return string representation weve seen fact string representation useful java object compare java object default comparison useful useful overriding method class theres thing lot fun maps end semester job object return integer thats supposed unique representation contents thats helpful normally default versions provided capital object useful design class override override string override equals right hash code work way thats appropriate class design java class decide means class equal class object sorry instances instance class equal mean write method okay hierarchy java tries find variables methods access use dot notation whats happening italian java know look method variable way works java starts gonna gonna minute java starts type indicated reference whats important connection references polymorphism gonna lot clear minute starts reference type says class variable method thats gets look parent class search little bit inaccurate search guided visibility modifiers private class string doesnt object string public outside class visibility modifiers guide search essentially going find method variable dont case fails compiler runtime error compiler actually tell know code didnt compile told particular method dot notation couldnt find right didnt exist class superclass right know talked specific im creating instance sweet old dog class im saving reference variable called chew tube stores references type sweet old dog right essentially print shoot dont know dont explicitly use string rid going work way print string happened called string print land called string object reference started sweet old dog said sweet old dog provided string method looked old dog looked dog looked pet looked animal finally animal found string method course remember got rid string method lets mark pried actually mark yeah okay thats gonna mad lets change instead dont method defined gets skipped im calling right im getting default object string method helpful right okay good polymorphism talked ability objects act differently depending context theyre referred makes lot sense start talk references understand references references determines context im particular kind java object whats know gonna_talk interfaces week interfaces java actually cool nice extension java class system hope clear exactly trying accomplish organize objects hierarchy like java okay im specific okay time talked want referred essentially means create instance object java object capital l object use different types reference variables refer object type class case created pet save reference variable type pet refer pet save reference variable type object refer object referred consequences terms im allowed reference methods im allowed okay pet referred object dog extend class im adding different ways refer particular type java object dog referred pet object okay heres java object want use want save reference requires casting tree example im creating dog im saving dog im carrying pet pet pass print im print taken object job fork automatically okay probably better let way okay line 9 reference variable type dog called choochoo storing reference instance type dog created right okay line 10 im creating reference variable called ziz type pet im store reference new instance type pet pass print java automatically taking reference casting object reference classes extend extend inheritance object extends object thats okay happen automatically sort equivalent lets lets draw little bit better object chuchu object equal xu zhu object object x equal zs way spell work okay thing pointed example time know know going times thats okay slippery stuff like im guys times chance ask questions start solidify mind cuz tricky know programming perspective hard week argue probably trickier conceptual parts class thinking objects relationship refer implications use things like tricky stuff code doesnt look hard theres algorithmic challenge theres conceptual challenge going okay line 9 im saving reference instance dog variable saves reference dogs thing line 10 pets line 11 12 cast references object im creating new reference variable called choochoo object im store reference shoot thats going reference gonna gonna refer object theres dog ive created remember dont new life created new object ive created dog okay ive created pet different references choochoo reference type dog pet reference reference type pet choochoo object reference type object object reference type object im passing object references print thats essentially happens print pass know choochoo ins directly sort whats happening scenes okay rid spurs string calls thats gonna work fine heres thing remember pass reference type object method clearly java remembers choo choo dog knows class object reference actually refers noses class type finding string method overrode dog thing thats tricky reference determines going minute reference type determines methods im allowed instance type resolving methods object reference im getting default object straight implementation dog dog reference object reference passed actually refers instance dog okay right sort slide says instances retain types know type okay talked know want point casts instances line im creating dog right reference save left reference type object chuchu refers class type dog want later downcast pet sorry yeah downcast create new reference called choochoo pet thats type pet reference variable im taking object reference im casting cast happen automatically dont explicit cast cast happen automatically explicit cast line 11 reason produce problem produce runtime error cast incorrect right lets lets sure works know created object reference line 9 downcast pet juju dog referred pet line 13 cast way dog true dog okay lets change little bit whats going happen run code minute lets think whats going happen line 9 im creating type object created okay remember ask question look look whats right new thats type object thats created refer variety different ways type object thats created pet pet going change ive decided refer object line 9 automatic upcast taking returned constructor reference pet casting reference refer object extends object okay line 11 im casting pet object reference want refer pet talk minute want going work object actually pet pet thats crate line 9 going fit yeah yeah right problem till im fine im trying refer pet dog cant dog extends cat cant create created pet referred dog okay let let example lets imagine dog method comeback later lets imagine dog class method called wolf prints console okay right heres im gonna lets choochoo dog woof okay added method wolf method dog class pets dont wolf method pet wolf okay lets replace pet happens promised runtime error class cast exception generated line 16 perform cast cant created pet cast dog problems example pet objects dont wolf method cant wolf dont know woof dogs questions kind places things start little slippery okay lets java wonder safely right saw example broke java provides way test class particular type instance know choose instance know inside tell essentially particular type class okay thing want point right lets replace time okay yeah compiler java compiler actually smart figure chuchu created dog im referring pet chuchu relationship strength compiler actually fail compiler helping compiler actually suss certain relationships classes dont want depth subtle case im actually getting compiler want right use dog im gonna gonna work properly idea compiler knows choochoo instance particular type wont compile code itll know generate error message force fix okay weve terminology quick review reference variables going going refer variables java store objects reference variables actually store isnt object reference object references reviewed time like probably worst day class conceptually right tough stuff references way thing talked examples references time phone number phone number phone lots copies phone number dont phones refers phone rings number hey street address know refer house house think lots copies address addresses reference house physical location reality thing gps coordinates guys working reference know like spot earth gps coordinates gps coordinates spot theyre way referring allow dont know theres bunch different ways referring spot use different coordinate system example social security number guys aware mean life sort ways defined references guys email address email address way people send mail email address refers particular email account right heres gonna bring ideas polymorphism references gonna crystal clear whats happening creating java objects saving references statement look statement line okay dog chu chu equal new dog new sound types guys state started learn recognize java classes start capital letter ive got couple class declarations right think heat coming thats good okay cold right statement line types point yeah whats okay wheres times dog yeah sorry times looks like type line right dog twice dog left assignment thats reference type determines type reference variable thats going store reference whatevers created right right nu looks like class type case things dont heres example theyre line line lets talk whats happening im creating dog im creating new instance type dog instance type follows new right assignment dont new didnt create ive created dog im gonna refer reference type object okay reference type left statement says im creating variable called choochoo object variable actually store references java object primitive types right job object im initializing store reference new dog ive created right precise whats happening instance type right determines kind object ive actually created reference type left actually determines types objects variable refer choochoo refer dogs descends dog choochoo object refer objects descends object okay dont create new know talked reference variables said copy references dont create new object order create new reference variable line seven im creating new reference variable called pet reference variable store thats type pet descendants store choochoo chooch dog refers dog create line castings im things proper choochoo line choochoo reference variable type dog cat refer thats dog object reference variable created line actually refers thats type dog safely oh sorry dont know happened thats supposed comment choochoo equal dog im casting reference variable thats reason cast unsafe possible object reference store reference string point wouldnt able going fail okay precise think going help instance type thing right new keyword thats kind type object actually created change reference type type reference variable refer particular type object instance type save save reference variable actually object actually refers type descendant type create reference type object java object system store java object okay heres heres comes play polymorphous job happens reference variables actually determines type instance variables methods access wondering like carrots like heres gets cool create reference variable certain type type reference variable whats determining methods im allowed right lets lets example okay actually cover slide right right lets slowly kind designed know hopefully good motivating example okay line 18 looks familiar create reference variable type dog use store new instance dog actually sorry need review whats happening ive actually added appropriate capabilities classes pet class talked abstract minute pet class gun owner method pet owner reasonable assume dog class adds bark method inherits good owner bark method dogs bark cant class ads method cats meow im example alright line 18 create reference variable called choochoo create dog object working entire example created line 8 dog sorry scared line 18 dog okay lets mind choochoo stops dog entire example thing changes refer okay line 18 create variable called choochoo referring treat dog reference variables typed reference variable methods theyre defined dog like bark methods defined parent classes owner string whats gonna happen run line 21 print lin case missed print lin calls string internal string print lin dont print object reference straight dont need okay far good hopefully doesnt know starting sense right bark thats find dog owners thats find pet parent string thats find object pets parent answers alright theres object entire example line 23 im creating new reference variable called pet called choochoo pet tight path choochoo dog thing thats changing refer choochoo referred choochoo pet owner okay strength longer bark refer choochoo pet reference longer bark example going work fine try run says find symbol weird dog stops dog theres object working thread entire example cuz refer choochoo pet longer bark let instead getting different reference refer dog object instead pet reference change names im going choo choo offended im referring hes cat couple lives hell pet reference variable store reference type cat cat extends pet cats cant bark alright cant wolf bark cat cant reference variable cat sorry object cat reference variable fruits pets things pet reference variable things know kind pet stuff defined pet inherited pet inherits case thats string things okay lets rid broken lets look final instance referred choochoo dog stop dog reference variable choochoo object type object methods know object cant bark object bark cant owner object good owner method string equals hashcode kind things okay know try youre gonna problem reason minute ago lets create string instead object reference storing dog stores reference object thats actually string strings cant bark strings dont owners cant print thats okay questions point know time got array reference example said need understand convince youve got today need understand convince youve got today right hopefully brings concepts closer relationship let pause minute like ive stunned people submission questions right weve lot cart horse today let talk little bit javas reference variables work way polymorphism java work way came office hours yesterday asked question wednesday essence question great question okay okay heres goes actually liskov villisca substitution principle ancestral relationships establish java essentially allow descendant classes modify behaviors inherit parents cant lose behaviors okay noticed yes java override method inherit ancestor cant rid java object way rid string override totally stupid return like null unhelpful rid string object string method tough like said break stupid know like equals example equals return false im equal useful yeah rid equals opt equals program cant polymorphism allows essentially write methods way thats general possible going advantage later class class huge fun actually start designing simple data structures algorithms gonna example build couple container classes guys frustrated limitations arrays actually implement called list thats generalization array couple different ways tradeoffs things actually internally cool thing lists able store kind java object know doesnt actually list implementation publish use dont know objects stored inside way okay polymorphism know talked tree want come idea incredibly know think kind tradeoffs time people work computer science experience developers time biggest ones generality versus capability building system thats going work case doesnt hard solve specific problem point able build extremely extremely good system small thing maybe tradeoff comes higher javas object hierarchy types objects work remember time class losing capabilities took choochoo refer pet lost ability bark donna pet bark maybe need ability bark write cool new program refer juju object lost ability check choose owner object owner implementing dog walking application problem like touch owner case know dog walker going late like general methods powerful lose capabilities know extreme case im working java objects couple methods turns methods actually useful able build cool things going later semester pick capabilities time class tree classes adding things right thats added owner property ability owner dogs added bark method cats added meow method objects work theyre getting powerful number objects work getting small ok like instance know deeper tradeoff computer science actually argue life future general good story minute ill come sure good right little bit java buzzword class bingo abstract mean mark classes abstract means instantiate class extend cant instantiate abstract class right new ive marked pet abstract cant create actually create pet descend class turns actually pretty use yeah yeah yeah question abstract class defines methods use yeah absolutely answer class works way normal class extend inherit behaviors stuff like cant create yeah create object want weve kind fun lets lets create object constructor super useful create math thats good question math think abstract final yeah yeah cant actually run constructor private access right oh okay mean talk monday asked want mention quickly private classes im gonna ask classes guys sort got hopefully youre getting good typing publics public class create private class short answer create java java class private okay youd following problem right use private class order use class able create order create methods constructor specifically class private cant methods okay heres actually going use inner classes little bit future comfortable little bit know mindblowing stuff weekend java classes define classes inside heres example dog inside dog class definition dog food class class use dog food class create like class works fine mark class private want example dont want use special dog food class market private works ok questions oh okay tired talking imagine guys feel listening yeah question static methods work polymorphism lets find right thats example lets create public static ill public static void oh doesnt like math example okay question static method lets work lets work lets cant pretty exactly way yeah great question questions yeah yep excite extend abstract class create new instance extended class makes sense pat abstract dog create new dog cant create new pet theres certain know lay save words abstract wrap wonder certain cases actually want classes store common information lot classes dont actually want able create pet good example right pet store common information pets create pet actually need tell kind right guys monday fantastic weekend think announcement kind nope remember office hours today till 800 wednesday office hours point ill guys monday stay
music right turns today actually friday good weekend coming beginning homecoming weekend guess noticed year theyre signs year thats kind exciting whos game anybody know whats uwmadison okay chance right today going finish talking class going talk objects lesson objects different object features monday exactly halfway class start talking algorithms data structures topic consume rest semester course talk algorithms data structures lot practice imperative programming remember long time ago involved like loops conditional expressions sort thing solve problems object design principles weve talking past month time time introduce couple new wrinkles comes objects kind big chunk okay video lecture recorded wednesday sort gave ramp interfaces want mop know dont going talk todays review couple problems ill work learn homework problems finished maybe end theres homework problems actually sign today tomorrow know im know realized havent lot chance ask questions interfaces topic tough know conceptually difficult suspect challenge thing want mind know particularly given semester bet looking know quiz scores happens time start kind new unit class couple use objects pretty basic guys scores dropped steadily steadily probably references rough interfaces week cant promise gonna better guys fine fact youre bit better semester know hang algorithm data structures things jump little bit overall scores class good im happy alright lets 4 interfaces know im gonna know kind kind quickly right youve heard times monday wednesday interesting like happens beginning class knock wood interface place computer system things come theres boundary things sort like border alright border actually bad way think right like border separate entities border systems come way navigate shared interface border share decide ok going communicate border rules gonna things things like right need lot agreement interface boundary border know parts system communicate lots different places identify interfaces computer systems reasons think important cover topic end unit objects idea interface general appears different places understand interface implies requires different parties apply knowledge interfaces exist humans computers interfaces exist different pieces hardware right guys know come later talking specifics java interfaces helpful actually map peter interfaces familiar know talk interface establishes contract set expectations parts system guys expectations interact computers human computer interfaces use youre aware example use apps phone click looks like button expect happen thought sort know thought process expectation building apps create certain layout theres looks like button looks like clicked theres word click expect happen app doesnt thing expected jarring right like broken weird hard use id know contract implicit like visual interfaces use right know important things interface place structure agreement documentation parts system operate independently think apple computer logitech little usb thingy theres interface interface pieces computer hardware theres software runs sides know hardware interface reason reason theres sorts different devices plug laptop theres standard theres agreement interface works look usb theres like document specification works shape connectors devices communicate connectors etc laid gruesome detail right way youd want know reason logitech dongle thingy apple laptop confident future weirdo like decides plug things itll work okay heres example interface interfaces java form looked wednesday actually declare interface java code interface java means specific meaning related broader meaning interfaces computer systems little bit constrained heres declare interface public thats visibility modifier vary starts looking similar class definition right ive got public instead class interface names follow convention classes theyre capitalized open block inside interface definition typically going focus looks lot like method declaration kind like shouldnt objects isnt right right way think interfaces look like class declarations methods methods definition theres method implementation theres signature okay interface says particular boundary exists function function called add takes integer arguments returns integer okay remember interface doesnt specify names arguments order implement provide function called add integers arguments add dont let fool imagine add called foo okay lets interface called foo know provided function called foo took integer arguments return injurer whats missing center base yeah yeah supposed right function actually supposed heres thing interfaces cool knew exactly function supposed implement wouldnt interface idea look comparable great example gonna use bunch examples work interfaces idea interface good place things know need able im sure exactly class actually pretty bad example know add numbers dont need interface called add right know write function look making objects comparable different object classes going implement comparable differently agree supposed work high level provide high level description interface works class implements interface allowed implement differently interfaces declare methods variables want point completeness utilize variable feature essentially variable interface declaration like public static final constant interfaces cant store variables way classes store variables thats right way think okay declare interface ive ive sort established contract im creating different parts system different parts system dont exist heres create want implement interface mean job mean thing interface know says meet interface contract okay case silly example add outer class saying hey know add numbers okay said theres interface function called add documentation says returns sum numbers interface going declare sorry adder going declare class declaration new syntax implements ad declare implement interface im required provide implementations methods interface declaration theres know multiple provide theres order implement ad need provide method signature actually implement okay im separating method declaration method semantics come talk minute implementation thats power interfaces thats useful end class okay interfaces dont allow implemented particular class multiple classes implement interface actually interface usually isnt useful multiple classes implement thats sort silly example implementation add dont need different implementations add theyre going work way talk comparable class implement comparable class implement comparable differently way thats specific particular class okay syntax right questions far review wednesday want guys chance interact know pretty everybody think new set ideas questions interfaces java syntax tree yeah true yeah question implement multiple interfaces gonna minute extend class java class parent dont extend class object parent class extend essentially public class add er extends foo implements interfaces want dont think thats right order try czech style yells wrong word think extends comes interfaces implement yeah great question actually let going gonna gonna second okay actually think example okay remember actually great review polymorphism references remember object instance object allowed reference type object type objects ancestors job object capital object reference turns interfaces worked way class implements interface declare reference interface type use refer class thats im line 12 okay lets carefully right creating class called adder new instance class left declaring reference called lowercase ad thats type capital add add interface reference store reference class implements add turns actually useful particularly start work container types work later ill run okay whats wrong code havent implemented adder class lets quickly example im gonna implement add interface declare im gonna implement add different compiler stuff compiler check compiler says okay said youre going implement ad interface dont method called add takes integer arguments lets provide public ad let clear use names interface declaration okay great works let let interface reference types important let class called broken adder thats going implement add gonna wrong change reference reference implements add refer broken door implements add run add function im getting implementation provided broken okay small add use better variable names stuff small add reference variable type big add refer implements adder implements add broken header implements heres place want clear way compiler know function supposed okay comes human beams involved stuff right let write interface im going add return sum numbers okay doesnt matter like computer doesnt understand compiler doesnt know read broken adder class totally dumb implements add far concerned right dont want think magic way compiler tell implement interface correctly check provided function matches signature expecting return zero mean know know way compiler check sure actually implemented interface correctly thats okay programmer responsible fact read return sum integers decided return zero instead yeah let let oh okay ah okay question implement interface idea actually lets try lets heres im gonna change gone im gonna rid implements add class declaration didnt remove function right lets try lets happens okay problem problem cant reference interface type doesnt implement interface think thats problem change adder interface add reference adder right know silly works fine implement interface interface guarantees people improved implemented interface method lets end class gonna example comparable like wednesday hope clear implementing comparable class declares know compare instances needs use feature knows class capability right implement function wouldnt sure right job wouldnt able sure class implemented function declaring implement add implements im allowing compiler verify class implements interface needed allows use interface types refer lets come talk later think itll sense great question okay right im gonna think im gonna sort breeze quickly covered wednesday level similar inheritance thats sort like right turns similar think right think interface essentially like parent class implements like extends like theres sort mapping concepts okay providing nipple petition sort like overriding method inherited parent parents parent question whats different turns similar think remember abstract classes abstract classes classes couldnt instantiate class extend turns fun lets point fact java abstract case ab tracked method java abstract mean abstract method cant provide implementation create method like create abstract method force extends implement method ad doesnt extend doesnt implement add says extend implement function okay let example oh lets actually lets actually change bullet lets abstract class public abstract int extends extends works interfaces gone took totally picture converted identical example uses abstract classes abstract lets happens decide im going implement tour lets implement add wrong type signature right whats going happen lets arguments similar error compiler able tell hey extended add class provide implementation abstract method starts look similar feature language question interfaces right need meeting heres thing good way think traits traits capabilities features classes provide classes provide dont organize jabez type hierarchy going come talk little bit talk sorting compare certain things classes able dont correspond inheritance relationship tree inherent extends means example class implements add inherit parent theres capability parts tree dont gets gets unpleasant impossible subject right real thing inheritance javas classes class implement sorry big thing interfaces actually achieve close whats referred multiple inheritance valid sorry okay im little bit brain fog let java said class extends parent capital object dont declare declare class declaration extend parent class implement interface heres example kind silly uses math examples interfaces add subtract subtract says class implements method called add takes integers returns internet subtract method says class implements method subtract takes integers returns integer math ii class getting capable kinds cool math implements boat implement add provide function declared line implement subtract provide function declared line 11 okay interfaces flexibility terms allow classes expose things useful right gonna good example minute right let let minute talk little bit conceptually sec reasons interface powerful idea interface represents contract parts system refer parts user interface provider interface place people confused lot let try clear class provide interface use interface providing obviously right provider user interface frequently class different classes class provides interface implements interface implement interface provide interface implement interfaces class class users interface separate code lives gonna need homework problems weve having people confused lot times theyll think okay told work comparables implement comparable necessarily told class comparable certain way implement comparable told find maximum array comparable objects dont youre user dont provide separate concepts theyre theyre inextricably linked interface represents information supposed need work alright lets lets comparable right comparable great example way better stupid math examples comparable interface real interface java incredibly right comparable interface sounds like single function called compare compare returns value allows determine order objects implementing compared allow object instance class compared instance decide thats implementing comparable cases comparable doesnt sense examine example imagine bunch pets know come arbitrary orderings pets like order weight order age order number traits orderings fundamental fact theres multiple problem right cases things like canonical ordering numbers example order small big thats fundamental property numbers lexographic orders apply strings pick dictionary ability find things dictionary predicated understanding order words appear dictionary words appeared random order hell time dictionary right theres day theres data world natural ordering debate isnt like hard fast concept right claim completely natural order pets species like probably thats little weird know reasonable people disagree certain certain things dictionary somebodys joker decided mean maybe guys try right little sort hobby project dictionary words random order right people buy prank right dictionary ive seen order suspect true languages right theres wellestablished way order things look stuff thing numbers right certain things agree theres order class natural ordering need need tell java interesting actually turns establish order tell given instances class order goes goes second tie theres ordering theyre essentially case comparative method returns zero cases goes returns positive case goes right words english language agreement goes dictionary numbers integers agreement goes number okay need know number objects order order come actually going algorithms question implement comparable turns theres code waiting java knows work classes comparable turns tell class order code waiting cool things example sort number instances class bunch unordered data like lets youre trying produce dictionary bunch words ill order right order youve class expressed find maximum minimum value predicated idea order maximum maximum item ends things order minimum item instances class order find maximum minimum theres pretty cool data structures going talk starting week build idea order things theres called binary search tree talk talk trees allows efficiently search bunch data items looking tell instances class order build binary tree data okay theres bunch things list okay heres let try drive home comes barrier sides contract said theres code world uses comparable java dont know theres code java written sort things comparable thats thats user interface code doesnt know class doesnt know class doesnt know data stored inside doesnt know long tell compare objects implement compared code starts work sorting code maximum code minimum code binary tree code starts working immediately soon implement compareto similarly implement compareto focus compare instances object dont write sorting code dont work binary tree code dont write interface waiting interface cool stuff expose class cool features right said lets problem okay im going version java pretty java comparable interface gonna use version minute okay homer poem think yesterday job implement class called string length normally strings java verify minute strings java implement comparable implement lexicographically implement dictionary order right going implement based length string think minute know happen tried build dictionary ordered shortest words longest words useful answer necessarily like imagine area fourletter words theyre random order youre like im gonna spend know thats super useful okay class gonna wrap string gonna store string internally going implement comparable okay implement comparable length string alright yeah mistake homework hopefully people figure documentation right starting starting week right comparable compare function returns integer determines item goes provided function takes argument item youre calling instance string compare youre comparing string called compare pass argument gonna negative specified object thats instance string length better ways handle people talk couple weeks best right theyre better ways handle case thing thats passed actually string link zero lengths equal negative greater longer length right lets actually im going pull dont need built java thing lets lets class work right review think worth gonna store string constructor takes string argument gonna use initialize class okay knocks strings like wrap string provide constructor takes string single parameter stored internally okay class create string length pass string stores string internally source reference variable called string constructors need implement comparable soon remember java expecting provide method given signature ive said im going implement compare method called compared im gonna implode simplement compared im gonna public int compare takes im gonna oh lets return 0 lets return things right trying think lets lets write little bit lets write little bit code works okay lets write lets actually write little maximum routine lets im gonna comparable max equal create array values gonna comparable values equal new string length ill new string length test array value think im gonna trouble chuck style yeah okay works lets lets write isnt perfect imitation lets write maximum routine lets comparable max equal values 0 equals 1 value values length plus plus values doc compared know backwards fix later okay im gonna print lin max right value lets override string little nicer lets return string saved okay lets string new string length im set im going jax allows nope set im going value right compare method isnt working lets create string length ill tested okay alright little bit code thats comparative method doesnt useful lets lets work properly right whats thing need help guys yesterday think yeah yeah reference type thats passed method object start useful know string length thing im going check im going check null im gonna check o actually reference string length instructions said return negative okay okay thats helpful thats thing want want able access string thats inside point know reference actually referring string length extend string want able string instance variable need yeah oh yeah actually thats good point right know im gonna cheat public right advocate probably actually know dont need dont need know methods defined class access variables variables string yeah thats good concern lets try lets okay lets try write odot string length length return negative odot string length greater string dot length dont know correct figure minute return return zero whats going wrong gonna compile good review review whats problem yeah yeah dont reference stringlength object ive reference object java know cant use reference object access methods variables object doesnt object doesnt dot string variable need need string length equal downcast string length oh need replace string length mad maybe need lets lets try making public lets helps nope ah length function yes thank guys nice right im sure thats correct gonna figure professor math high school actually great guy people fond stuck man help guy know like whod sit laugh stuck know got end class little bit early appreciate got help right looking maybe correct lets try values lets try test okay supposed return maximum looking correct sense longer value beginning im gonna okay like working okay questions yeah right yeah remember reference type good review references reference type determines methods variables access object reference string hash code equals cant cant access string refer thats string line right cast string like reference guys generate method intellij gonna thing code writing easy generate right check null check instance string length instance type downcast things reason yeah great question questions okay code currently thing want point currently string length provider interface string length sorry string length providing compared implemented comparable provided implementation function user example main method example class example implement comparable doesnt need fact string length implements comparable happening youll right case casting remember implement interface cast object implements interface reference interface type thing array right let brief format totally little bit easier little easier eyes okay plus work change right assignment im creating array string length objects reason cast comparables going question earlier implement comparable interface problem okay kind want want finish making clear right let lets fun lets pick implements comparable thing im going choose implements comparable string string implements comparable said string implements comparable differently looks like okay sorry ive got need fix backwards right right string implementing compared implementing lex geographically putting things order alphabet order maximum string alphabet order like right wants want accents thank right come right need add zs okay little subroutine wrote look starting line 30 comparables knows string string length number implements comparable power implementing interface ive got code right kind silly method know nice able find max having write code time nice people sort having write code anytime sorting actually hard gonna_talk sorting like week different sorting algorithms performance theres sophisticated ones want use particularly lot data okay implementing comparable unlocked world code operate implements comparable string length string integer double hang trick okay cleverly left time todays homework problem promise wasnt intentional know know know thing im able accomplish cool stuff right day beautiful day outside hope guys enjoy enjoy homecoming weekend good luck wrapping np checkpoint released blue team sunday night orange team monday everybody good luck finishing mp guys monday fantastic
music right everybody welcome today continue fun class understand couple classes today going talking lists gonna look portions implementation list remember time introduced idea list list generalization array list data structure like array brings order elements unlike javas built arrays useful features change size add things add things middle elements set way normal right im gonna add features guys working implementation simple list interface homework problem parts today class look code gonna_talk different way implementing lists going way kind nice review theres parroted programming concepts interfaces second way cool actually going draw things learned learned objects gonna inner classes going going use object references order provide structure add structure data thats today monday week guys second midterm cbt f starting monday class monday review objects thatll day problems guys ask questions try ready wednesday come continue work lists guys homework going week know people pointing maybe mps getting little bit easier maybe thats okay homework problems actually gonna start little harder know dont worry plenty month half right lets review little bit time reasons work list gives great chance practice algorithm analysis skills gonna start practicing look data structures start build algorithms gonna build computer scientist programmer care getting work computer scientist care works understanding works certain conditions different conditions given different inputs different know situations thing going perform right thats things sets apart know grab code stack overflow integrate project bad thing thats way useful work time time know guys studying best institutions country right want come leg peers places youre gonna ability implement things super useful fun understand able good choices youre faced tradeoffs lists turns presents actually interesting performance tradeoffs implementations list interface going produce today week actually gonna different performance characteristics certain operations interesting alright usually know talk algorithm analysis usually interested talking problems big thats kind reveals fundamental underlying behavior algorithm algorithms like big setup phase right imagine algorithm like big phase sorts like small pre computations things like goes massive loop right run small input stuff end taking lot time inputs larger larger larger loop looping entire input eventually time program spends algorithm expense going loop going reveal o elgar right beginning fooled fact theres constant time steps big limiting behavior algorithm clear kind algorithm im looking okay good way going guys know exposed sophisticated approaches future gonna 125 semester try things categories based performance related input right use idea big o notation right essentially big o notation allows categorize okay categories limiting behavior particular algorithm right inputs big right heres favorite graph look different types limiting behavior know essentially slowness think slowness time takes algorithm complete yaxis size input xaxis huge differences right know ive got algorithms like constant time algorithms im realistic know log n algorithms solve problems depends problem right theyre way theyre barely growing number elements increases know o n factorial algorithms know taking like theyre going mars right taking like spaceship slow quickly algorithms nicer ones slow slowly imagine know think think difference height imagine problem certain size imagine im google massive data ive collected want sort like right imagine oh log oh oh n squared 2o n log n speed going difference particular point lines right 20 elements im seen factor 3 speed o n square o n log n algorithm looks like factor 4 right difference difference know computer taking know running like kind thing like better cup coffee know deep learning algorithms talking benefitted recent advances algorithms long time run right read people training datasets takes hours hours days fast machines better algorithms imagine long took slow algorithm right like oh im gonna train deep learning data set im gonna vacation finishes ill years right useful right like identify cat photo ok maybe needs run bit faster useful right started having guys work homework problems general data structure called list great starting point talk data structures algorithms ok list builds understand youve seen arrays remember arrays data structure arrays items order right data structure adds structure data bunch unordered objects list theyre order right theres additional piece metadata index ive associated element right hes arrays tremendously useful java arrays irritations particularly youve programmed python javascript languages easier work order data lot modern languages data structure list list like array know set values way array notation java notation okay java gonna use set list object limitations java language didnt sleep spots think operator overloading maybe c bracket square brackets anybody know maybe point java syntax list going look little different square brackets access element im gonna actually function im gonna dot im gonna pass index want set cant array bracket notation index equals array dot list dot set passed index new value okay little bit explicit whats going functions im calling right cool stuff right example add remove values place list values middle end right lists tremendously useful heres example write practical problem extremely irritating solve array trivial solve list imagine youre reading data file guys know file anybodys heard file think know file im facetious like yeah yeah im sure know file file stores data computer right computer turn theres piece data inside file theres sequence bytes right interpret different ways lets imagine torpid nimis series lines text imagine file data like population champagne given year going 1870 like imagine want read file like compute average size champagne population increased rate growth bend different time intervals heres thing open file start reading lines dont know lattes file right java arrays okay im gonna read count number lines file create array right size ill actually read date thats thats irritating want able list create list start reading data file time new piece data push end list thats actually useful reasons lists feature thats built lot new programming languages thats added existing guys 225 guys lot work vectors basically lists different theyre similar behavior okay chance trade offs going use notion interface introduced right gonna create different implementations list behave identically okay theyre gonna implement interface dont know kind list kind list works way scenes going theres interesting tradeoffs right lists going start looking come look idea later okay theres different types lists gonna look okay look guys working look code today java known arraylist people arraylist john okay pretty common yeah weve taken ap youve probably worked arraylist array lists list arraylist list internally arraylist stores items array guys implementing homework arraylist way java implements free java standard library know dissimilar okay array lists following tradeoffs arraylist fast look item set fast ill minute going look code exactly theyre fast utilize property fixed size array looking item indexing array constant time okay constant time lookup sf arraylist adding removing arraylist slow o n size list modifications access constant time set elements constant time arraylist start adding stuff things complicated oh n behavior ill guys writing code right exactly n o n comes loop write order work end todays class way implementing lists uses linking object references linked items linked lists space arraylist going talk length different tradeoffs looking element linked list slow wet adding items linked list particularly adding certain positions general case inserting item linked list o n special_cases constant time special_cases turn significant special_cases turn match common ways use lists okay big tradeoff interface right list use identically regardless ray list linked list linked lists java ok theres actually linked list class java lot people dont use lot people dont understand use lists java point ive colleagues like oh array lists reference im like thinking class right thats way theres lots different ways implement list okay thatll sense minute alright present little bit different memory usage tradeoff linked lists efficient comes memory okay actual java list interface okay want frighten anybody okay actually thing right look interface java doc itll tell classes knows implement interface ones weve talked heres arraylist heres linked list theres called vector java right theres called filtered list dont know theres copyonwrite arraylist sounds interesting different implementations interface meaning reference list use identically whats cool interfaces regardless stack know arraylist vector okay classes implementations list interface theres couple problems javas list interface reason guys read actually theres lot useful stuff right java list interface lot convenience methods dont want implement okay whats called generic interface syntax come talk couple weeks right thats going lot sense talk generics java thats kind polymorphism actually gonna look semester okay thats gonna lot sense list interface simple list interface alright guys working homework theres quiz questions class okay sort like distillation minimum things list able okay lets set right promised like said lists java objects cant use bracket notation okay bracket notation java square brackets use raise languages know relax limitation java bracket notation array bad force brac lists look little bit like raise maybe useful theyd easier transition fact want use list replace bracket notation set ok ive got yo takes index returns object im gonna create list store type object ive got set method ok nice nut takes index object reference time kind review little bit references right return object reference allows store type data list list store strings integers ill remember primitive type wrappers quickly talked time type java object stick list kind cool ok right ive got getting set methods pulled array things arrays dont size right sizes arrays size method proper right like string dot length ones know interesting lists lists add array add object index okay remove object index stick new element list causes size increase end middle okay remove item list add item need pass reference object want add remove item receive reference object removed dont use maybe want throw object list entirely convenience remove method passes reference object removed ok right lets look little bit starter code gave guys homer problems think actually solution homer promise guys yesterday okay doesnt add thats guys working turns remove add similar alright promised heres interface right heres implementation class called simple arraylist arraylist implementation promised stores objects list array array im going use internally reference array objects havent created dont know big right internally reference im gonna use array store object youll getting set right work right ive private dont want somebody access im gonna force use set access items array lets look gettin set functions ones easiest understand okay ive got checking right im basically checking sure index valid okay index negative greater equal length array remember index thats equal array dot length 1 past end array valid index array length n n minus 1 okay ive got pass bad index return thats true set set doesnt return pass bad index doesnt right way handle problems talk later talk exceptions bad index add im gonna return null bad index set im gonna fail silently okay thats input chucky robert check inputs sure inputs sane time line 23 line 29 know index good line code right im going return reference stored array index im gonna change reference array index reference passed okay store null references array want pass set index element null array element thats going succeed okay remember tradeoffs time takes complete operations lists remember time talked constant time operation looking changing element java arrays constant time okay ive got constant time check constant time operation constant time check constant time operation looking code set constant time operations arraylist questions hand maybe stroking hair right right makes sense okay lets look lets look constructor okay constructor constructor takes reference array okay way create list array array references array references objects create list happens essentially constructor says okay array let scroll little bit array needs size initially array passed im gonna set array array object references size array pass check sure raise right need prevent passing bad bad input theres better ways handle array pass copy references im array references array passed okay erase private cant fact youre user list dont know theres array right im gonna know later today wednesday totally different way implement lists theres array weve_got private array array list implements lists storing things array kind copy way im probably different types ways copy things youre giving array object references kind copy yeah fact shallow copy im copying references array array changes objects later array gonna reflect changes sets references objects theres new new called dont new new called new objects created new objects created im usually shallow copy deep copy id actually figure way clone copy objects pass okay questions look good stuff okay far pretty basic yeah yeah yeah question quiz question reimplement entire list interface sorry entire arraylist guys think sounds like fun actually quiz question mean like functions implement yeah hope yeah right lets look remove okay right mean look remove know add sorry lines 3 error checking sat lines 3 error checking remove lines removes got meat lets care okay heres arraylists start array arraylist starts cause problem okay heres heres need okay ill try use analogy help guys imagine row auditorium thats people want somebody middle arrays work need essentially im storing list order finish job need end array fewer element means im gonna ask everybody row half row number people road shift right mention somebody middle people right everybody left seat ive created space end essentially copy array new array size smaller right let ask question couldnt leave null reference heres way implement remove lets instead removing element actually making array smaller lets set index array know work mean maybe rid cobie stuff deal ad removal little bit easier tell problem im gonna rid code im gonna pass remove index im gonna lets know like way work lets array remove index equal null return like lot easier whats problem essentially havent implemented remove implement yeah yeah null value im allowed stick right okay values arraylist lets lets look example code example code creating new list integers lets null value nulls valid value insert arraylist instead removing value set null im essentially set right theres difference remove set point im changing value index right order removed work actually going shift right makes sense right imagine remove value right imagine array remove value index lets right okay simple lists remove zero ill ill print little statement separate whats going okay actually lets fun lets index value index okay want remove read official java list documentation lister works remove actually value result values shift okay started list element second element element removed zero gone ive modified indices values shifted left right know value 0 2 sorry null index 0 2 index 1 okay wanted happen lets remove actually works reasons im similar app guys working ok need remove thing im going im gonna check im gonna check inputs im making sure remove index valid ok place know people usually implement ad use remove starting point thats fine subtle changes ill case people stuck check little bit different youre adding new value want think okay lets remove fine essentially cant remove item index refers item thats list okay dont bad index im gonna im gonna fail alright lets happens remove index happens right index negative happens okay remove valid index happened okay thing im gonna need value im going return reference value thats removed grabbed right away okay ive got reference dont worry comes right im going return right im returning value called return heres interesting stuff happens okay thing im going remove going reduce size array array referred element array size n new array im going elements needs size array length minus create new array tricky know guys ask form talk essentially index loop im keeping indices index array im copying thats array thats object class thats donna ray index new array original index original array new indexes new array okay heres thing need copy original array n references need copy n minus 1 new array tricky figuring skip theres need skip thats im removing heres chuck basically index im copy index im trying remove bump original index forward okay think works okay like point im copy want skip original index forward copy new array new index equal array original index lets little bit code guys working lets original index ill order okay heres place im im actually work okay remove step time come loop copy 0 0 thats item ending place second time come im copying 1 2 sorry 2 1 im skipping skipping 1 1 index asked remove array longer lets items right pattern continues index im copying things position index want remove jump forward original array im copying past position newer ok original array looks like expect value removed right questions know got smee looking objects like month havent seen code like suspect brain probably hurting good stuff questions okay guys good variant today yesterday probably lets look code want going today wednesdays gonna comparing different ways implement list arrays linking lets look code n set know im saying look code order answer kind question code look start building association features code complexity classes set ive got loops im array lookup java constant time operation operations constant time look remove okay removes little bit interesting right ive got check constant time constant time operation oh n come y remove o n yeah ive got loop yeah exactly starting line 43 loop loop goes entire array break statements theres return know im regardless element im copying entire new array right beginning skip beginning end skipped end ive essentially rebuild new array copying guys finish add youre gonna adds small right oh alright feel obligated point fact theyre simplest possible version okay befits class guys sorts cool clever ways stuff faster lot essentially tradeoff performance space imagine instead heres problem right problem time remove essentially allocate new array copy right turns particularly ads faster keeping array thats bigger need dont need step allocating new array right essentially implementations lists work right start list elements space like 32 32 add bunch new elements like oh okay im gonna like 100 space 220 like oh wow things getting bad im gonna space thousand dollars 24 know right helps doesnt mean copy things internally having reallocate memory going help takes time job okay questions arraylist arraylist im going briefly introduce linked lists come wednesday questions list stories values array yeah yep yeah question youve radius java youve able tell job type object supposed list okay kind advanced feature java dont feel super comfortable talking little bit later class gonna_talk generics use yeah time guys able build list store type object essentially thats useful lot places allows better error check yeah java generics things dont like java want use simple list kind essentially mess generics somewhat complicated yeah great question questions okay let introduce second competitor list competition called linked list array lists useful lot people use theyre built job linked lists useful linked lets place deep bowels operating system runs computer lot performance critical application theyre interesting think okay remember goal list items order thats structure list brings data array allows array allows index index im bringing order things right things order heres way putting things order okay heres example class called item class store class stores things stores reference object okay thats data piece structure knows item list okay things right reference object thats data like arraylist array object references linked list items store references objects thats good reference item actually example recursive data structure data structure definition depends reference okay reference item reference called reference item list item link type list know index knows things heres piece data heres item list youre working okay heres use create list essentially start creating list hold im holding reference item thats reference start list okay beginning create new list basically putting integer list setting item list value okay item reference know want add item heres right thats good gets true gets tricky okay heres going talk right expression im creating new item object item holds reference integer item items points starts evaluated started evaluating items pointed item value zero finish evaluating holds reference newly created item items ive order alrights items ive order reference item list item reference item list item reference mean list items knows list theres index item class knows things heres data heres item list theres item list im item item references okay gonna start homework know week start work class okay heres thing want point implementation simple link list class going use inner class feature talked briefly want sure doesnt scare anybody okay class simple linked list eventually going implement methods list interface arraylist class implemented internally uses class called item class anybody needs know simple linked list implementation having separate file level im gonna inside simple linked list class declaration called inner class dont work different classes java fact classes try use class dont necessarily okay know inner class scary know like class happens declared different place right okay oh inner class methods okay important inner class method access variables enclosing class theyre private code inside item access private members simple linked linked list class okay kind kind important alright okay lets talk know code works fine right playground know theres compile run stuff right okay lets lets start looking actual code different operations want linked list alright gonna process gonna incremental right working linked lists introducing today guys gonna peek come talk wednesday guys homework problems week recognize think think complicated concept people deal mainly involves linkage working references ways going strengthen understanding references theyre gonna feel little bit unfamiliar strange okay thing actually going little point implement list interface gonna start small thing gonna gonna implement called add alright add implies special case add eventually guys case add remove special case add list easier thats gonna start okay let look list interface thing thing thats cool simple linked list remember arraylist stored array object references internally thing simple linked list needs know list start internally thing stores defines new class going use wrap data gets inside piece information need class maintain piece called start start reference item list find item find item find item find item beauty linked lists dont need array store reference object list instead store structure objects item stores list structure stores reference imagine know talked know arraylist sort like bunch people sitting sidebyside know blocks chairs linked list like gave person person thats list person list start auditorium okay know whos person list find person maybe theyre balcony okay whos person use create list items okay right lets come start wednesday think good stopping point didnt far wanted thats fine mp3 earlier deadline week good luck deadline day look forward seeing guys monday great
welcome everybody im gonna blast dicks lot cool things look today gonna implement sorting algorithm going look little glimpse trees trees manor bester theres new feature jobs javis type system gonna introduce today gonna gonna fun alright lets start little warmup problem trees remember said know start learn write recursive algorithms mean chris dog herbs cool right mean theres theres real high degree elegance achieve choose approach problem recursive manner break smaller pieces solve smallest problems combine result important remember theres problem solve recursive algorithm cant solve iterative algorithm theres problem solve iterative algorithm cant solve recursive algorithm pletely complimentary think good way convince essentially flatten tree use tree store bunch values ways programs weve written run trees like im looking value im searching value tree write program run list wonder like storing values tree started look binary search trees ok ive got additional structure tree allows log n performance search kind cool lets lets demonstrate tree list actually taking tree converting list pretty similar homework problem guys wednesday alright heres gonna usual going design recursive tree traversal algorithm going visit node tree add list gonna list contains values original tree possible use liss things like lets want find smallest value entry largest value tree tree values list sort list know answer questions okay right base case know usual ive reached tree reach tree dont nodes tree need add list im good recursive step usual im going consider right left subtree separately order sure node ends value node ends list add values right subtree base left subtree values rights right way combine results use list im adding list sure children left tree chance add children right torpy chance adam selves case know skeleton algorithm weve writing programs weve running trees pretty similar case kind interesting way going combine results actually gonna create list wrapper function gonna pass list recurse tree way combine results essentially modifying list okay let pause talk data structure guys actually implemented lists tremendously useful data structure know lot know tell people think actually true lot computer scientist data structures list called map talk weeks right lists incredibly useful dont understand use lists maps theres lot important highimpact real world problems work solve thats kind need right answer data structures come handy know certain places stuff like particularly building prototypes solving lot problems lot realworld impact dont need lot fancy data structures right lists maps right weve implemented idea work know real world programmer typical approach need use data structures implement good idea fact bad idea job people going concerned look youre person world want use list people working long time existing list implementations true trees pretty data structure think good reference implementation pretty programming language think youre taking course youre implementing fun learn work grab ones java packages arraylist linkedlist people tend use okay heres heres place going going introducing refreshing concept interfaces use write little bit differently ive ive created lists reference variables ive got list reference variable called list ive got reference list reference variable called list list java interface interface arraylist linked lists implement list functions implemented set add remove bunch useful things okay arraylist linkedin plantasia interface taking right im creating new object casting list wonder list line arraylist reference list line linked list reference nice thing use list later want switch arraylist linked list easily changing lot code okay lets actually use solve problem heres list promised list interface java theres dont understand thing triangle brackets couple weeks fact start talking today feature jabez type system known generics allows create containers hold specific kinds objects knowing kinds objects actually going hold right create different types lists wanted list reference list reference interface type hold arraylist link post sure heres people know colleague like oh yeah know use array lists problem later code realized problem im solving better served code run faster length list cant switch im stuck suggest use youre list reference types list types arraylist types alright lets solve problem reposed want tree want values list okay im gonna values function lot times wrapper functions immediately called private function started root node im actually going use chance create list im gonna list values im allocating reference variable type list im gonna create new lets use arraylist use linked list array list actually switch minute ill easy im gonna values im going start root node im gonna pass list values private wrapper function looks like takes current node list values okay whats base case stop want start base case sure whats thats whats point ive reached smallest problem yeah note null point tree right current equal null theres nodes right im gonna im gonna return list past dont want modify theres note add ive got things ive got sure value list sure right subtree left subtree right chance im gonna im going values add current value remember correctly puts end list doesnt matter didnt list didnt values lists order okay im gonna im gonna restart values right child im gonna pass list im gonna restart values left child pass list im gonna return list value values left subtree values rights right lets works works okay work lets additional nodes lets sure works list good okay questions example probably little bit cleaner little simpler anybody want suggestion modify slightly small tweak think allow little bit little cleaner help little sense suggestions mean pretty good heres try heres whats_interesting wrapper function creates list passes reference list private function right essentially start wrapper function hand list created wrapper function returns means nodes tree visited theyve added list return list reference allows wrapper function return void doesnt actually need return list needs sure passes list right left subtree chance add notes little little bit cleaner questions ive got ive got nodes list right lets wanted know figure particular value tree right weve search right list values binary tree values integer values know equal 8 ill print oh yeah right okay gonna yeah okay come fix slides yeah theres theres problem list getting list objects right right let let know let talk pointed minute ago instead array list references use lippert release references change easily lets instead use linked list store values works fine yeah essentially nice thing interface reference variables tying specific implementation right dont need know list works need able add items right code needs know values add item thats thing array lists linked lists fancy think theres called tree list stores things internally tree gonna gonna behave way perspective yeah yeah thats good thats great question depends answer question yeah yeah essentially tree built randomly look add going root note node half time twos gonna white half time thats gonna left okay look algorithm algorithm adds nodes right left half time finds right half time finds analogues sense yeah run run bunch times know time suspected looks like determinate want think half time expect time dude great question questions right time introduced sorting algorithmic challenge exciting interesting problem deep roots thats building block lot things today gonna look sorting algorithm called insertion sort start talking merge sort end class today mean dont run time lab week guys going chance work selection sort monday come talk quick sort merge sort quicksort cool theyre examples recursive sorting algorithms ones interesting tradeoffs todays sorting algorithm kind fun iterative sorting algorithm sort warmup right lets talk insertion sort right heres heres main_idea insertion sort heres array unsorted values right sorting arrays sorting array integers gonna sort ascending order sort sort raise compare values sort order want sake simplicity gonna default sign insertion sort tries step algorithm tries increase starts left builds sorted list array right sorted okay insertion sort step algorithm makes list thats sorted item bigger taking item right unsorted section moving place sorted section start heres thing start right implement gonna allow sorted section start value array value sorted right need need need sorted array order maintain sordidness array okay sorted section values unsorted section remaining continue process seven seven sorted array okay seven needs im gonna threes gonna way beginning im gonna form know finds right spot im gonna 11 11 stays woman largest value turns right spot im gonna ends kind smack middle step requires taking 11 moving way formation okay step algorithm conceptually called insertion sort value insert sorted right spot okay know step took inserted array right spot took negative sort negative array right spot continue process obviously sorted array getting bigger step going n steps finish job question long step o n algorithm n steps run start think comparisons perform figure particular value goes okay lets look little bit carefully think yeah version kind showing sorted item ended right ends great lets look single step okay thats outer operation algorithm lets look single step inserting value right place okay lets sorted array values blue item im trying insert sorted section remember know blue values sorted im going use algorithm know stop dont know right essentially implementation going work im gonna start right im gonna start moving left time im going compare value essentially step compare 11 6 11 bigger 6 6 11 right thats case values position right 6 loven actually way algorithm gonna implement going swap right im gonna swap 6 11 6 needs left repeat process compare 6 8 answer yes needs right needs left compare 6 7 6 7 yes 7 goes right 6 comes left finally value sorted section 5 6 5 found right spot stop thats im going insert 6 ok step algorithm exploiting fact blue array sorted know fact sorted means soon find value thats equal 6 know right know belongs found spot right ok questions actually try sorting algorithm medusa mail system yeah left right lets look diagram hey yeah arbitrary decision right way going implement insertion sort sorted starts left grows right implement started right grew left point value right right idea step value want insert value unsorted section needs sorted section start right right actually youre swapping values start place right yeah essentially way works internally guys minute swap im im moving swap swap seven swap stop right im essentially im moving values exchanging yeah great question theres theres different ways implement implement sorted section grows left values right implement throat section gross left mens values left combinations right think sort makes sense versions intuitive great question questions right lets bad boy try time year practice class tricky right lets easy lets check bad inputs null array im going return null think array lets think single step works right outer loop essentially place im growing sorted array okay remember theyre outer step algorithm growing sorted array value time im gonna start zero right ignore value im time starting sorted section value thats sorted right means asked sort array array value implementation going stop quickly doesnt ask sort array im gonna enter loop okay okay im gonna start im gonna start j value im gonna start j value start minus started actually need start im gonna start j8i right im im moving index beginning im taking value j im going want zero far needs unsorted value value j want left im going continue long j greater zero im gonna decrement j time ill greater zero minute right heres useful think time lets lets imagine thinking values time equal okay start j values want compare values index 1 values index 0 okay want want input array j minus 1 greater input array j need swap means value left value left greater value right need swap ive got ive got values array place eventually sort array went compared pair values value left value smaller index equal greater find greater found values position gonna gonna swap standard swap think know looked earlier semester order sure want swap array j minus 1 ray j order need temporary variable dont lose value case array j minus 1 create temporary variable set j minus 1 overwrite j minus 1 j set j temporary variable original value rage mattifying okay lets actually works oh look pretty nice heres thing let theres thing need order sure performance want right lets look algorithm remember essentially weve implemented step taking value unsorted array moving left comparing neighbor find spot stops going insert add represents theres moving run little faster represent point like know goes right essentially code inside loop whats swapping right point im swapping lets diagram insertion dont going dont need look examine 5 amp 4 4 amp 3 right know theyre sorted ok add insertion sort recipe yeah lets break statement dangerous lets gonna work im saying 2 items order need shifting unsorted item left right spot 2 items order ive entered sorted array im dont need going way beginning right lets try sure works ok cool questions like good know know guys know started imperative programming wrote kind gnarly stuff like weve seduced objects know middle semester didnt write complicated imperative code yeah insertion sort selection sort know tricky think questions yeah ah okay lets come question better way n squared answer yes lets come talk minute yeah great question lets think performance algorithm actually okay want want count number swaps return ill print number swaps okay sort array required 18 swaps right lets array item bigger requires 22 lets lets item requires 23 ones end thats problem like right requires 26 way bat 35 okay yeah values array looks like 10 thinking 35 swaps problem right time complexity algorithm right whats worst case lets think array step remember insertion step stops soon finds right spot whats worst case insertion step started right keeps swapping swapping looking spot insert point yeah yeah value belongs beginning array meaning smallest value array drag way left okay right thats worst case insertion step whats worst case input insertion sort lets lets lets eighth item array values job insertion sort long possible values gonna theres actually lots choices whats going true dots yeah theyre opposite order yeah lets try lets seven seven twentyeight yeah bad gets like time ive got value ive got way left way left way left right swap lets try 4 5 27 right like little bit better worst thats funny agron works day time ok best case input right thinking inserts yeah yeah sorted ok lets 3 4 5 6 7 8 didnt know swaps right time went array picked unsorted right spot right id work know slightly order right lets got swap right order okay worst case oh n squared array sorted reverse order theres theres constant factors im ignoring example exactly o n squared swap time swaps stops swaps right outer loop running end times inner loop starts running ends running n inner loop running like n n squared right best case array sorted right average case know places depends data typically quoted insertion sort oh n square thats random inputs right worst case backwards best case sorted heres thing thats cool insertion sort want remember sorting algorithms talked class worthless value good thing insertion sort fast array sorted lets data youre pretty sure sorted want run sorting algorithm sure insertion sort good choice array sorted fast okay algorithm start talking minutes recursive sorting algorithm called merge sort property log n array sorted okay insertion sort nicely nice thing certian sort said doesnt consume lot extra space implementation essentially extra temporary variable want clever actually declaration temporary variable outside array outside loop sorry temporary variable thats rest work inside original array right look merge sort look quicksort gonna worse space complexity computer memory task merge sort sorry insertion sort like gonna temporary variable im good right alright gonna start filling big chart coming look merge sort look quicksort self id summary insertion sort okay think mentioned time know better right particularly average worst case performance sorting algorithms prove worse oh n log n right find sorting algorithm oh n squared behavior average worst case know optimal right know better alternatives okay let let brief brief digression java generics sort start speed mind things gonna come downstream right actually reason problem earlier youre gonna use lists lists super useful right gonna use maps builtin java data structures future lists problem observed actually minutes ago decided solve excited okay heres problem way weve lists right told java type objects gonna essentially list guys ongoing conversation class hear hear yeah thanks distracting right list ive created line list objects heres happens add string list java casts object line 10 try pull java wont downcast sort forgotten kind object says object reference thats know object reference thats useful right know whats list explicit cast right print value list thats string runtime error gross okay remember like month ago talked fact things weve trying build better programming languages allow compiler check things code compiled compile code runs compile code development process right compile code run app compile code run program okay compiler catches error going program isnt created java like im gonna build program know problem right things catch compiling code better right place like compiler helpful right compiler knows objects list doesnt know kind didnt tell kind objects wanted list heres bit syntax unfortunately guys learn start use triangle bracket notation new thing generic whats called java generic type instead reference list variable energy list reference list going store integers thats im telling java im saying im gonna use list store integers store cast integer know integer descends energy thing im creating thats gonna hold strings okay need type reference variable create containers youll triangle bracket notation left says reference variable refers list stores integers right tell arraylist class arraylist going store integers second time arraylist gonna store strings okay heres whats cool heres whats nice okay pull stuff oh angry maybe maybe examples im gonna work ill fix class right things strings theyre gonna come strings actually let example worked right right lets lets list strings heres theres good things gonna happen compiler help write compiler knows list supposed store strings compiler sees line im trying add string compiler gonna complain compiler error thats wanted wanted help compiler thats string like test thats okay things list theyre strings right gonna use im gonna guys practice later guys actually gonna use build generic classes hard wanted pretty pretty useful right thats useful way youre working java container times okay think ill think ill defer mergesort overview monday instead want talk final project fair prou leave coming semester flown mp4 weekend lab thanksgiving gonna sorry lab week thanksgiving gonna start thinking final project wanted started thanksgiving guys partner know find work start thinking maybe bored home know youre tired watching football eating turkey spend time actually working want alright heres thing gonna fair fun unreadable obably like midafternoon kind right dinner theres usually food dont tell anybody participate final project fair important note okay cant require rainy day percent extra credit come demo app okay usually like big siebel probably bunch siebel classrooms spaces building okay heres gonna job learn software development learn computer science youll job promise right gonna good job right like 30 years ago bad jobs tech cool like somebody microsoft maintain crappy legacy code right know good job sense pay good benefits know produce knife worklife balance yeah exciting like cutting edge changing world like maintain clippy equivalent clippy dont know like decide dont want good job heres heres job great job classes know projects good grades mps know youre standing line career fair couple years everybody thing youll brag got 225 people 25 like lot okay stand distinguish identify passion technology youve academic career things know tube know 225 mp4 mp checkpoint 125 doesnt youre excited field okay want great job tech way passion technology things teach courses springboard learn find right gold project fair hopefully light little bit spark started youre line talk google like hey built bus app thats app store thats actually thousands people paying customers true story ben nordic bus app started 125 final project use theres like 5 paid version sort quest track different bus stops visited sounds pretty cool right site guys look terms projects year know bar final project pretty low know ive seen guys sucked excited incredible things right page inspire intimidate know long try long work partner dont turn clearly generated watching tutorial copying code online gonna good score final project gradient generous right hope starts start learn think independently find problems work team okay got weekend hope guys fantastic ones supposed warm little bit good luck todays homework trees little bit doozy hope enjoy
music hey everybody todays little bit different gonna ready code today going analyze algorithms going know rat try rep remains mount mysteries recursion learn new feature java classes devoted introducing think need reintroduced thats new think granted grew grew know students class im guessing probably born turn millennium right guys actually know came time thing going talk fairly mature things know goal today actually try mystify guys use day shape future technology going forward need understand order understand best leverage world technology internet world wide web thats gonna_talk today going conversation monday designed set work final project best ways build mp4 wraps weekend best ways build impressive today little work possible leveraging work people app program use data computation features provided called web apis monday talk little bit actually amounts function internet remote server work cool retrieve data locally run processing power locally major know guys mp4 level youre completing checkpoint think actually probably checkpoint right guys attached app backend way pieces code communicating whats called web api talk monday today goal little bit sense internet actually okay talk web web apis think helps sort think little bit talk little bit internet um sort guess surprising works lot people including lot computer scientists include lot people room dont idea actually works guys sitting laptops im sure youre looking directly beautiful slides youre youre know tool service youre online right turned internet room think attendants probably drop bit right obviously attendants drop zero attendance tracker work think people stop coming know think way computer today internet connection growing computers spent long time high school long time connected internet weve_got little bits internet time use week mom fairly divide brother sister stuff like like know discs aol 30 minutes divide 30 minutes carefully um expect devices laptops phones little know 5 devices buy amazon right online time right created revolution today going talk internet little bit internet works hope fun like stuff think internet probably significant piece technology humans created know yeah fight want fire wheel stuff like think internet actually transformative things think internet reflects fundamental human desire communicate thats invented written language wanted able communicate document things internet sort ultimate flowering desire okay like talking stuff taught entire class know years ago internet find videos online including videos like know going wall jack office ripping figuring going talk little bit today later write hiding server rooms stuff like good stuff want know theres lot videos talking pieces okay end day thing guys right know computers room wish like data probably communicating thousands computers spread world okay place cool right work whats evolve way whats special things going talk today right thing internet know theres people seen internet series tubes video thats meme think precedes guys little bit 10 years internet series tubes series wires graph showing overlaid map united states main internet backbone links weve established country right pick map france pick map australia looks kind similar pick map know africa certain parts world looks different world countries ways weve enabled internet weve laid cables okay going talk cables heres map showing act actually use map figure like lets youre facebook right lets youre actually talking facebook server thats located california path information taking california people people thought maybe happened wirelessly like satellite like right anybody think mean reasonable thing think guys wireless device right case alright happens wire lets right chicago theres lot internet connections come join chicago couple major cities right internet traffic probably youre communicating server california start gonna run high speed internet backbone companies operate infrastructure heard google google facebook started little pieces right companies operate names youve heard right fastest highcapacity links weve created run hundreds miles right talk little bit exactly data gets place know probably young remember al gore talking information superhighway information superhighway right real thing okay sort spot map theres interesting map look connections yeah whats south dakota yeah whats going thats interesting yeah highspeed connections south dakota apparently isis know noticed theres like dead ends like oh sent data south dakota came feel like likely south dakota like didnt share data survey like ya know thats interesting seen drive country driven big interstate highways overlay interstate highway map map youll lot internet backbone links run major highways wouldnt run know point point b yeah yeah yeah actually like bury cables right theres process involved laying maintained okay putting alongside interstate highway system makes little bit sense right theres features interstate highway system try duplicate example know wondered like im highway kind like like dont highways straight like know im going straight chicago 57 run straight chicago like dead straight turns reason actually guys distracted driving fall asleep know right im highway designers build little bit undulation order alert right thats sections highways dead straight ive read things like know higher accident rates people distracted right right okay heres question interstate highways theres older map right theres map overlay thats gonna line anybody know match interstate highways interstate highways cases laid follow youve driven 57 chicago notice alongside good route railroad yeah theres train line like actually fought internet actually following paths laid hundreds years ago country decisions railroads decisions guided highways gonna decisions guided going internet infrastructure kind cool right case talk internet connections span span continents okay want clear think surprising cables wires wire want actually follow path data facebook twitter instagram server youre communicating wire building right theres comes right router start router pull wall im gonna greg mad theres wire follow wire data travelling wire meets building theres gonna locked cabinet thats gonna bunch pieces equipment thats wire leads follow theres wire leads follow wire theres live leads youre gonna wire router way server big warehouse computers world traffic spans continent youre communicating server thats actually located england australia underwater alright actually start undersea cables know centric maps realized heres map united states map showing lot overseas cables pulled enable internet communication long distances cable runs like east coast united states bunch cables run terminate bunch places west coast europe right know putting pretty expect theres boat sails port got literally big reel sailing ocean unraveling unspooling cable right floats ocean floor deep sinks lays know tens hundreds years oversea cables operation decades okay dont pictures actually find stuff fascinating like infrastructure want find play eastern seaboard place cable comes water right got come typically nondescript buildings build sort sensitive sites like terrorist wanted attack united states knock communications infrastructure knocking oversea cable line try theres like big sign says oversea cable internet right instead places ive actually built buildings designed look like apartment buildings outside lives theres car parking lot whats inside building place cable comes hooks parts internet infrastructure know sort easy identify buildings sorts coolers theres lots electronics places theyve try facade look like yeah question idea think start right question like repair things new ones think probably easier care want talk minute older versions cables literally actually vacuum tubes like mile running right stuff good shape theres lot redundancy theres lot cables pulled north atlantic example theres bunch cables pulled pacific ocean connect asia places right goes offline necessarily end world theres spare capacity route point companies heard like google facebook cables theyve decided actually start establishing infrastructure entire cable cable right means data travels cable like google data center cool data center facebook data center place today big internet companies started data actually sense start investing directly infrastructure need right cables okay heres support things sort surprised started learning stuff right hope theyll surprise thats cool time right heres fiberoptic cable right know level kind mockup underseas cables look like right youve got outer sheath youve got bunch individual cables inside material little threads poking anybody know fiberoptic cable dick glass yeah individual fiber hard probably easier running glass actually theres upstate new york western new york theres corning company corning old company years years glass things like plate ware cups saucers stuff like right think like growth industry corning factory like incredible visitor center like dripping money cornea making money buy companies world glass high quality use fiber optic cables actually theres actually years ago actually bit shortage fiber optic cable running try build internet faster allow carry data companies couldnt actually high cost facilities need maintain glasses quality understand isnt glasses doors fallen tour glass thats screen iphone high quality clear pure allow signals travel long periods cables actually actually thing thats cool glass find fiber optic cables way quicker think building lets thinking router pulled router wall cable going copper cable run meters signal refreshed amplified usually find building switch takes copper cables comes oh come dont thank comes glass fiber optics building right fiber optics run probably sort maintenance tunnel building meet fiber optics things actually got chance tour university work know guys use lot data right mean thats fun thing college guys browse web time assume thats right sort like problems think data like water right assume campus theres like thick cable need carry data guys use right sense right browsing web time guys like streaming movies stuff thats like uses crazy amounts data shouldnt like thick know cable maybe like like right turns traffic university size carried couple thin pieces fiberoptic cable stuff good high capacity shocked find edge campus like pipe like im gonna wire going data entire campus traveling right goes city champaign maybe meets cable suspected traffic eventually gets chicago knows right things away okay gonna_talk wireless infrastructure minute infrastructure weve create support computer network right transformative know way connecting everybody earth wired real physical stuff wireless mainly edge network today time way guys connect internet phone laptop sort wireless connection right ive got routers case dont know wireless router theres dozen arrayed fold injure provide coverage building theyre campus right wifi infrastructure right like billions wifi access points people set places phone connect different type wireless infrastructure talk sex thats mainly hop past point rest communications wired infrastructure right think investments weve physical infrastructure support system right thats whats cool wired wired connections duration glass soon possible fiberoptic cable higher bandwidth requires infrastructure right long know mile cables talking theres way run copper require infrastructure fiberoptic cable carry signal miles little loss signal little degradation signals long way hit piece infrastructure refreshed right mean think things enabled internet work extremely clever computer scientists talk glass fiber optic cable mean didnt built internet right cost way okay kind guys want thought kind fun links videos ub essentially kind like started router jack wall kind watched process getting campus right find right person talk right theres somebody let networking closet wire runs maybe union theres closet follow way campus person know like data goes point right right talked little bit wifi right know thats thats guys think kind seeing right ubiquitous wifi router right short distance wireless infrastructure think learned identify kind cool connections phones theyre outdoors wifi mainly establish connectivity indoors cities europe places united states actually find wifi like public parks new york city chicago right says cellular data connections set right okay people seen like notice like ive driving particularly long highways cell tower okay things right basically kind equivalent guy theyre little bit different operate different frequency range protocols connect clients little bit different cellular radios okay theyre hooked tower youll theyre connected theres distinctive tower right noticed unusual theres whats distinctive geometrically youve seen ways identify whats typically true true city find wireless routers attached building like right building owners rent space cell company infrastructure building provide service particular area particularly space right know hinterland right located whats true towers theres common clue cell system set notice twice yeah yeah ive got equilateral triangle right towers feature ive got base tower thats configured way ive got second little higher tower thats configured way actually probably different cellular providers sprint atampt equilateral dont good picture unfortunately turns want cover space towers possible right way cell look like equal outer hatch agon allows basically tile like tessellation right im tiling entire surface illinois trying sure given point youre range towers serviced places hexagon comes equilateral triangles tower serving cells antennas pointed way company right tennis pointed way serve cell theres tennis pointed way sort cell innocentive pointed way sort cells sort cell towers actually positioned different cells come thats goal right whats_interesting course know companies agreed best way divide country parts triangles aligned differently right probably means know probably agree tower place kind compromise theyve turned theyve decided divide space little bit differently right actually mean previous years mean guys right know second big evolution internet went thats think ubiquitous right wireless connectivity weve built required enormous infrastructure shortrange wireless connections use refer typically wifi mediumrange wireless connections set set typically operated cellular providers right okay result right cool animation essentially showing animation thats estimating internet activity different parts world time day right watch right probably morning united states right evening things little bit quiet heres morning periods time country actually massive email spikes people got work like everybody gets work oclock thing check email suspect thats true anymore people checking email time right theres probably little bit spread right notice map right look think graphic couple years old probably far today notice observations internet internet propagated looking yeah yeah favor populous areas right look like example australia like lives middle australia right like desert goes hundreds miles right population australia lives west coast actually pretty accurate right theres little chunk people like theres lights middle theres theres little population level follows population theres huge population center reflective actually right know look united states kind look australia kind lives great desert europe kind know pretty densely populated telling yeah son theres data like like answer answer theres data africa right thats actually case right theres little internet penetration africa little internet usage thats great point look know populous continent dark point cant remember exact numbers change frequently think point like 60 65 percent population earth regular internet access okay guys privileged 247 access internet regular internet access mean like maybe day internet cafe like right thats mean regular based definition 65 percent wiped coast oh yeah dont know help like boundaries contents right yeah dont think theres thats great question dont know white theyre know actually bet know white think theres people living right gonna live greenland theres plenty coastline right isnt youre gonna live right doubt people live interior green suspect actually probably following population guys exciting thing right think think easy today feel like guys little late party party internet youre theres earth worlds population havent brought online people interesting internet users people people access internet gonna totally change lives right know weve kind brain people weve hooked internet right world people bad like okay better access netflix know people dont regular internet access internets going start connected gonna potential change lives guys chance involved right heres thing right end day work weve actually know think morning hes sort wondering like drives human beings right drives things right like build things like yes true internet lot people rich right think work thats entire globe create system think theres deeper fundamental going mean youre sitting room browse website countries friendly relations chips right weve decided hey connect networks right allow citizens know certain cases theres plenty internet censorship know allow know use facebook exchanged messages right mean think theres deep human_effort right people human beings want communicate kind beautiful example working countries nations friends enemies variety different contexts like happen right online potentially connect billions machines right shared infrastructure weve built right time connection wireless point theres wire literally follow persons computer alright substrate right built wires way send electric signals electronic signals point point b havent actually answered question going use capability enable devices communicate second level level internet represents physical infrastructure huge investment physical infrastructure thing got agreed agree going use thing actually enable communication okay requires new concept computer science concept weve talked computer science community know contributed system mean think till right weve talked like ece right built hardware stuff wires ee lot right thank right thats incredible contribution right point need start writing software okay communication protocol protocols energy word mean protocol roots know diplomatic relationships right protocol receiving head state right comes visit white house theres set rules follow theyre received sort know banquet youre gonna hold address walks door second like negotiated right communication protocol similar dissimilar set rules establish devices communicate way send signals forth actually use signals represent know bits use bits represent text images work doesnt cacophonous right work actually sense thing right um ip know people heard acronym ip like computer requests like ip address id ip second place word internet right ip stands internet protocol base protocol internet connected devices know expected adhere okay designed address couple fundamental questions use network okay couple things ip best things ip doesnt okay talk little bit design principles monday internet successful best things ip small minimal set expectations requirements things ip sets thing problem big network need address address want communicate facebooks servers news feed send message message needs destination needs source server send data okay ip specifies format referred ip addresses right heres ip address whats called dotted decimal form right iteration ip probably mistake creators ip anticipating big internet going talk minute case right old format ip addresses okay people seen looks like couldnt sign router youve connected okay people seen looks like right future future mean sixth version ip protocol rolling like decades okay heres problem ran ip got started ipv4 address billion reasons complicated want tune point clear going run know theres billion people earth devices know probably theyre going right wed 8 billion devices need connect clear 4 billion structural reasons difficult use addresses im going okay slowly surely internet transitioning use different address format new addresses longer sort like difference int long java store 4 billion values long store like lot right ipv6 think remember quickly separate ipv6 address atom universe thats probably right dont know atom decides wants laptop phone trouble right thing ip lays messages send stuff going structured ok know sort sort format thats dissimilar designing object java right need decide know send message whats gonna message decoding sending random stuff wouldnt information figure message youd like okay got data dont know decode right information right format going test thought guys interested format single message transmitted internet whats called ip datagram lot stuff dont need worry right information called header message pieces pretty important right things message contains travels internet came thats source ip address thats computer sent message identifies thing contains critical going message trying thats destination ip address pass theres information eventually information data things ip guys learn courses powerful beautiful idea ip didnt create rules ip message header err right thats agree stuff thats data send want doesnt matter person youre talking agree interpret data ip doesnt care ip objections moving want long set header problem dont want talk topic giving credit people involved im want important way right look people slide kind old white guys right theyre old working lets time 50 years right actually 50 years ago internet machines actually arriving campus internet illinois actually hosted nodes internet like point computers hooked internet idea use happened bunch graduate students got ahold right people like excited work new stuff want figure goes professors like im busy ive got paper write graduates like somebody sent big piece equipment mail lets play cool stuff thats started essentially graduate students country different institutions unboxing big know things like size closet right barely right boxes im hooking phone lines figuring connect stuff like time mean read interviews guys mean vint cerf alive bob kahn died unfortunately vint cerf works google sort internet evangelist continued speak future internet kept saying kept wondering like people charge going sort feel like story technology era right bunch like people kind making went kept wait like literally kept waiting like point government going suit like okay guys got right plan weve turned plan protocols invented graduate students like graduate school found cool problem work worked think extremely laudatory way look internet actually standardized theres bunch documents lay internet works way laying ip bunch protocols operate internet talk time knows called number theres like thousands theres acronym look like know theres website single going dawn internet know theyre called theyre called rfcs maybe rings bell men descending know c stands c stands request comment graduate students charge worried offending people charge didnt want documents like like instructions right didnt want people think oh graduate students started right agreed wrote request comment send know later people suits came theyd like oh know asking help request comment right didnt comment decided ahead thing mean process system persists day theres committees involved know continuing guide shape future internet use rfc system propose new ideas feedback right think going stop talk routing time thats today fantastic weekend beautiful outside office hours today 1 2 3 hope working good luck finish weekend machine project deadline start final project week great weekend
hello hear oh sounds better alright friday jeff foreshadowed things called functions functions way structure code break pieces reuse test excited gonna great id like moment talk going class point semester week class getting rhythm right hear hello right hear right thats problem survive saying wave class getting rhythm class intense youve probably starting discover try maintain consistent level difficulty reason weve weekend homework problems prepare working machine project mp going lay weekend homework problems pretty want work mp instead mps obviously theyre longer homework problems longer means scheduling highly recommend started early designed doable slow steady progression designed frantic rush night try gonna work hot lets settling sunday ma monday depending deadline group youre going finishing half checkpoint early deadline points going finishing checkpoint starting checkpoint released checkpoint boundary monday mp continues course quizzes cb tf run monday wednesday class right weekly homework daily weeks homework problems office hours run noon 800 tuesday youll continue working np youll repeating theme quiz continues c btf labs tuesday course homework problem wednesday fairly similar monday quiz proceeding weve_got class weve_got homework weve_got office hours thursday great day lot progress np theres cbt f quiz going lots lots office hours friday theres office hours happening weekend lay homework problems plenty time work office hours run noon 800 saturdays sundays far class weve learned important fundamentals able basic math arithmetic operators simple decisions statements lot things variable number times loops store data variables arrays computers good communicating obviously important world people constantly sharing information web gonna happens gonna exciting fundamentals going going thinking use gonna building blocks algorithms solve realworld problems data processing tasks going consider lay data process effectively course people theres big rage data science data structures important computer science theres different tradeoffs different ways structuring data access going learn way reasonable way maintainable gonna learn craft know use kitchen accoutrements doesnt necessarily chef people attest cant cook craft layer tools way outside critical parts java programming general gonna couple fun detours things like compilation exciting bits works fun lay programs good way allows maintain reason want organize imagine reading syllabus class imagine section breaks giant wall text mess navigable organized links things dont repeat constantly functions talking today going allow entire program long sequence instructions going wrong hard investigate problem break apart independent chunks test isolation youve identified problem chunk fix chunk going combine state behavior foreshadowing called objects think going later week allows behavior code processing organize things operates dont trawl entire code base find related going learn write good documentation understand code later people partners new startup able understand weve course weve come long break know whats going computer scientists far fundamentally lazy want thing solution fantastic use structuring programs allows weve organized documented wonderfully people use code help avoid code duplication help build fantastic stuff foundations youre communicating contributing software development heres wikipedias definition function sequence program instructions bunch code code like weve writing far perform specific tasks accomplish thing maybe job find maximums andre like weekends homework problem review later today unit programs particular task performed function accomplishes tasks dont need copy paste code place need invoke function job different programming languages somewhat different conceptions functions shared gonna_talk java specifically gets handful inputs cases returns doesnt answer produces output response example homework problems common need find given input like sum array input array output sum theres super magical code inside function imperative code like weve writing packaged nice way use like said sorts code inside function inside function plan general function responsibility perform atomic specific task like somewhat bizarre array sum function responsible emailing know function job summon array thats want easily tested going wrong program lets fuck problem exhaustively test function oh okay function behaving properly code dont test entire program youll np reused multiple places copy pasting code place mistake original implementation got copied mess clean instead package function mistake change users function updated behavior fixed actually write things ive spilling 12 minutes function declaration java thing youll notice like variables names functions names refer inputs function receives called arguments theyll referred parameters inside parentheses look like variable declarations type int number saying parameter add function int inside function referred number parameter int called second number like loops statements functions body delimited curly braces inside function run function called code fairly human readable text big comment referred javadoc comment java documentation purpose explain function humans understand use use general summary job function add numbers parts expected passed function parameter number add second number thats input thats second number add return sum numbers youre going lot comments mp code describe function supposed strictly speaking comments necessary compiler start writing functions later mp checkpoint textile require add appropriate javadoc manor studio help help format think important write java doc people later understand function use java cares bit arguments return type try use function java going check things passing actually type function expects java doc helps helps people function theres information pack function want explain java doc weve written fantastic function super amazing want actually run code act declaring function doesnt doesnt run use syntax involving parentheses shortly function execution transfers immediately function gonna examples real quick code calling excuse code calls function caller makes sense weve started execution function called function going run completion completes function called continue executing control flow soon function returns functions function returns like expression example calling add function lines add functions declaration lines 11 15 loose code takes advantage need shatter bit illusion weve instructions java statements slide examples homeworks java actually allow loose code outside functions try independent java file outside system work java requires executable code packaged function weve little bit magic scenes itll function test function going use add numbers notice syntax looks somewhat familiar considering line 14 system dot dot print line weve time function print line function calling involves parentheses function want value parameter rest parameters parameter_values separated commas checks ill want space line 11 declares result java fill evaluate expression righthand function add weve result likewise dont store intermediate use expression add 4 5 pass straight system dot print line line 12 going evaluate ad execution transfer line 9 add 4 5 hits return statement proceed caller system ritalin value work send console multiple function calls expression like line line 13 java evaluate time itll add 10 20 20 30 store bigger result function returns value required value line 15 perfectly fine add function add dutifully add numbers result gets thrown away caller reasonable throw away result maybe function sideeffect return value lets actually run code youll notice weird static word artifact slide system ignore include static prarie learning problems think things break alright talk later later class run code coming probably line right wheres ninety coming add print lets maybe sense control flow adding extra print statements youre debugging like mp helpful add print statements sense java running code lets gonna type onehanded start weve called add function lets add code ad able run think im typing best copy print parameter_values colouring lets note ad lets happens obviously havent instrumented entire thing think pretty good sense declaring function run going start inside add function instead execution begin line 6 thats beginning imperative code result going need invoke add function java transfers control body add function note adding 3 amp 4 hit return statement return came function called hit line 8 notes adding 3 amp 4 process executing line 9 print statement add function evaluate dont know print dont know print ln weve evaluated inside add 4 amp 5 ready pass resulting 9 print ln multiple function calls java time scroll java added 10 20 20 30 got got 90 line 12 prove java actually run function ignore return value adding 6 amp 7 threw away results 13 like variables functions names names going function want scripted want mean quizzes functional names like want figure function describe youre writing code function mean remember describe specific function maybe plan function think gonna code develops ends doesnt describe lead confusion sure functions actually describes function behavior expected baffling thats problem youre going function names places code probably best wild length like 50 characters probably pushing descriptive describe whats going lot horizontal space screens nowadays trade descriptiveness succinctness probably best describe people know declared function gave names parameters inside parentheses like said looked like variable declaration fact kind youve function declared parameters certain names inside function variables names need declare inside function value going caller example line 14 caller decides wants supply 3 value number parameter different calls function parameter_values probably different pretty expect 3 result number excuse value number change maybe add 9 3 23 hand typing music sure value number 323 expected oh order parameters matters order pass youre calling function match order declared case ad commutative addition operation commutative doesnt matter functions yes definitely need sure value want pass parameter oh way case parameters add intz match return type function takes int returns string string return double independent happens example theyre example saw return statement youre looking mpl ready youll seen couple thats perfectly fine return statement says executing run function caller ive ive work appear soon dont unconditional state excluding statement contains return statement want bail function condition multiple return statements maybe want circumstances return thing execution falls reached different return statement returned value return immediately bails current function execution proceed past return statement long actually executed mean executed statement condition false wont run wont bail execution reaches return youre function function declared return value return statement answer caller expecting produce match declared return type ad example declared return int written statement returned string text work java complain vigorously compile code function doesnt return ill second declare function doesnt answer dont return statement want bail early necessary control reaches end function job automatically return dont return value wondering java doc normal comments custom format looks nicer use javadoc convention tools produce quote unquote pretty web pages like thinking web designs little dated probably entry function jump tagging turned things like descriptions turned nice text return tag turned nicely browsable people look web page having code fact mp looking especially future checkpoints javadoc generated solution code tell functions need questions proceed good alright ability package code function use im algorithm algorithm charge specific task like summing array solving data processing tasks like mp algorithms inputs data need work result need produce exactly suited function model taking parameters returning result build algorithms fundamentals weve learning point use arithmetic operations store results variables variables changed middle algorithm use accumulation like array problem different things different circumstances conditional statements theres lot data need process variable number things need look thats loops lets examples lets array characters want find case letter letter approach going need ideas yes yep said element array example position value position value position found match note update variable yes great need entire array need compare adjacent value gonna feature java allows yes yep use loop exactly theyre store variable print lets try array called characters gonna write function task lets want return number times identical character function return kind thing yes yes int int return type function goes going need descriptive function lets consecutive identicals little long typing hand input function kind thing ideas yes yep character array array cares need yes karis sounds good open block function curly brace need closing brace like said going need loop use enhanced forloop going index based loop yes yep index based need know index look previous lets set normal loop index variable cares dot length increment need current character going cares indexed eye going want check current character index compare things equals looking plus yep wonder work oh course going need variable accumulate declare outside loop declare inside loop reset run loop outside current character equal character found increment loop tell caller hey found answer gonna work oh definitely work declaring function invoke need function want pass character array called characters oh way parameters function accessible outside function cares consecutive receives gonna pass characters charis parameter run gonna work oops forgot static gonna work oh array index bounds happen yes yes im run tried plus end array fix yes yeah carousel length minus stop penultimate entry check entry work helps actually print result right got answer look reasonable b b c think nice right lets want write algorithm average array hint problems weve similar yes yes finding sum array want average bunch things need add divide number elements lets try writing function going need static slide sandbox work probably return double going averaging double precision values think average going need array doubles numbers going need accumulate sum far variable whats reasonable starting sum value yep zero use enhanced forloop indexed yeah hear serations enhanced yeah purpose need values dont need index double number numbers array accumulate value return weve calculated sum oh answer yes yep need divide sum numbers length numbers array lets function average array declared use run average point seven looks pretty reasonable nice lets review weekend homework problems finding maximum array human imagine human pile numbers basically unknown length collection wanted find biggest reach end hint probably going need check maximum value going need track biggest thing weve seen far maybe theres early array maybe later encounter biggest number maybe smaller numbers later dont want set maximum saw bigger start declaring function static gonna need semicolon inter data intz think maximum reasonable function input going integer array numbers going state going need keeping track need variables outside loop remember think havent looking sorry yes oh youre stretching stretching hes stretching think going need variable recall biggest weve seen far human going start floor oh okay biggest thing ive seen far look element oh thats beats previous best ill hold mmm thats smaller ill ill negative oh thats great ill hold time maximum weve seen far 10 weve exhausted array weve seen return biggest good needs accumulator biggest happen initialize zero problem yes possible negative values instead lets initialize value thats definitely array ah maybe element numbers slice zero going datum array going value use enhanced forloop lets ahead number numbers array gonna need bigger current best conditional smaller weve seen dont want store interested number bigger current best gonna changing biggest value store recall weve far best current number oops helps type properly close loop loop weve checked number weve stored biggest variable called biggest save caller heres answer going need function actually think clipboard sure lets works oops helps oh scoping issues biggest accessible outside function need actually passing values right try maximum 10 work maximum middle array work biggest number start array edge cases cause trouble sure problem input maximum function cause fail yes yes array instead passing values pass array integer array zero elements boom zero bounds array elements unclear case want avoid crash purposes exercising ability return early lets want return maybe negative thousand smallest value youll youll probably sentinel purposes demonstration numbers dot length zero return negative thousand theres java constant called intamin relevant try negative thousand theres array change values return statement hid numbers dot length zero execution proceeded loop wrote wanted function like homework stuff biggest know spacing bad oh right yeah called number called values sure works solve weekend homework problem spacing correct questions lobby lecture unfortunately cant stage need way lecturer ill happy meet lobby jeff wednesday hopefully theres homework problem today quiz 2 multiplechoice questions functions wont writing functions quiz youll answer couple questions mp started come office hours need help especially come office hours need help setting android studio theres early deadline points making progress weekend thats folks great day
welcome hope fantastic weekend today okay hard believe fourth week class week course start counting zero today beginning week class half class like called week believe guys midterm exam cbt yeah reminder like quiz comprehensive format similar guys seen weve covered point fair game week monday im going start talking new topic objectoriented programming little bit left actually wednesdays lectures lot fun gonna_talk little bit sort java works scenes clear things confusing today want introduce piece puzzle comes represent data java weve talked working single types single values weve looked able work series values going start expanding dimensionality work 2d 3d 4d higher dimensional data java gonna look work multidimensional arrays thats kind topic course rest week homework quiz know mp0 np thats week practice write practice imperative program okay reminder early deadline deadline day weekend yesterday today good luck getting 40 points p0 coming weekend deadline day saturday sunday monday questions policy know wouldnt let honest talked fall spring started talking moto course staff lot like know dont want deadlines like students arent gonna like know far guys like ive stunned submission like mean wants complain somebody wants okay yeah question miss early deadline minutes let summarize told respectfully didnt follow instructions right follow instructions laid fact says clearly download zip file use starting point let lesson points youve lost dumb reason sure doesnt happen nice thing semester past like np different people kind mistakes time semester youve got set push properly run local auto grader youre confident working right shouldnt run problem lost points time gonna difference grade highly unlikely itd lesson following instructions starting getting help need questions yeah yeah read form said read forum thats discussed forum yeah autograder working working itll soon wanted work properly actually testing lot work weekend thats coming okay heres im gonna right think theres legitimate concerns multiple deadlines approach heres heres promise end semester compare performance orange team blue team emp theres significant difference adjust final grades sound reasonable okay significant mean like couple percentage points percentage point noise floor theres big difference dont expect big difference adjust direction know surprised okay great weeks midterm covers point review friday special guest friday stay tuned help review trying figure prepare midterm mps working fp0 great way homework great way quiz great way today class programming problems firt quizzes quiz wasnt interesting programming problems homework 125 problem set theyre practice couple people making early quizzes thats okay gonna continue homework week midterm want point easy getting started stuff objects important lose time plan hard homework problems poem problems week days little tougher start talking objects week pretty basic yeah question book applause mean questions book easier whats right dont know pick poison okay questions started today yeah questions book weeks kids yes ya chapter signed yeah graded pushed youre good run auto grader machine push thats way sure didnt math wrong didnt miss things arent working expected right youve bad know happens know people modify test suites theyre working try help forget like oh got points test use test suites ones gave modifications compute thats check yeah right yeah mp checkpoints think like actually sorry think think starting zero theres mp checkpoints theyre obviously going weeks long dont time shorter yeah mp chuckles okay lets expand dimensionality data work work series data useful theres lot information world lot data world represent series values started adding dimensions good shape talk objects good okay java declare use race multiple dimensions online im declaring array called samples single dimension single pair square brackets left thats tell java want array int dimension right im initializing 2f size store elements valid indices 0 3 line 6 im upping game bit twodimensional array pairs square brackets left declaration right tell java create ray initialize large dimension says dimension size second dimension size 8 valid indices dimension array 0 3 valid indices second dimension array 0 7 array store 28 values right okay lets continue ad infinitum point youre going tired typing square brackets line 11 im declaring 3 dimensional array doubles dimension size 6 dimension 8 second dimension 10 dimension meaning valid 0 5 dimension 0 7 second dimension 0 9 dimension cant store 480 values right talked onedimensional rays talked fact associating metadata item array mote single dimensional array item ray new piece associated metadata single index twodimensional array im associating pair indices piece data threedimensional array im associating triplet indices piece data thats difference internally think computer actually stores information long array best way think computer memory huge single dimensional array trickery things look like dimensions end day stored single dimensional array computers memory purposes programming useful associate pieces metadata integers piece data integers depending data working oh yeah dont okay im gonna blow past quickly gets java gets confusing quickly line im declaring dimensional array normally access values inside dimensional array use pair indices dimension second dimension im indicee turns single dimension array java storing arrays inside arrays multidimensional array single dimensional array value array think think single dimensional array int size 4 value array integers size okay lets yeah know commits lets play little bit doesnt print lets print size samples slice array length size 8 right print length samples print length samples youll high school yeah 1 dimensional array size 4 value onedimensional array size 8 dimension value inside second array array raised inside raised arrays okay happily dont think gonna torture anymore mp multidimensional arrays heavily static array initialization mp terrible start assumptions data screen wrong based array like initialize single dimensional array want static initialization use brackets use thing java array im initializing array dimension array size 2 array inside dimension size 2 dimensional array dimension size second dimension size use slide access values inside twodimensional array onedimensional array inside brackets twodimensional array use indices pair brackets gets value array value summary think ive associated lets look data metadata data data inside stored inside array value metadata associated pair 0 0 stored value 2 associated metadata 0 1 store value 3 associated metadata 1 0 ok maps confusing dont suggest wont okay right lets okay heres thing want encourage problems guys use arrays people taught rows columns high school class okay im sorry know dont know maybe home thanksgiving find person conversation fact talked rows columns spreadsheet concept relationship use multidimensional arrays suggest try know hard like movie eternal sunshine spotless mind right erase brain actually good know people teach physics deal peoples misconceptions world teaching physics actually figuring convince people theyre wrong stuff find great videos online know theres people seen theres famous video harvard mit commencement ask people explain seasons happen seen happen suggest find youtube watch funny okay thought people smarter think right watch video maybe dont know seasons happened watch video youll able pretend dont talk rows columns class let words escape lips confusing concept meaning second dimension multidimensional array totally extra pieces metadata associating piece data inside right particularly important start working certain types multidimensional data youre gonna rows columns thing going think youve organized data inside particular way maps particular spatial orientation thats wrong wrong depending person setup problem youre charge meaning dimension inside multidimensional right totally appropriate problem youre solving data youre modeling multidimensional array right apologize sort started worked forward instead weve talked type information think good fit stored inside multidimensional array kind data world sense represent store multiple pieces metadata yeah images right okay lets think image whats data yeah yeah pixel particular like little dot color right imagine im putting photo little dots color dot value determines looks like whats metadata thats data remember metadata important data picture whats metadata im putting lets im putting photo ive got pixels different colors im try assemble photo pick metadata yeah goes position know imagine start square canvas im sticking things value color metadata position yes picture consists series pixels heres random photo right way computer represents breaks tiny tiny tiny pieces grid says im gonna break know depending large pixels picture looks fuzzy look sharper right theres certain number pixels certain number pixels zoomed zoomed zoom didnt zoomed youd eventually squares single color data actual color pixel metadata position like music think apparent sound photo position important took pixels scrambled wouldnt nice photo black white photo waterfall like static look like wow know loses meaning metadata matters lot scientific data multidimensional dont remember know imagine maybe like temperature surface volcano like heres volcano representation dimension actually right ive got dimension dimension dimension height im color represent fourth dimension dimensional data right know order figure know given point need know space dimensions color dimension right dimension right music okay confuse talked music single dimensional music actually typically youre listening record player old joe biden music typically multidimensional actually record players stereo sorry shouldnt joke sense music dimensions music yeah okay represent represent music general series measurements pressure thats single dimensional data set second dimension coming im giving big hint picture yeah series right time values measurements pressure dimension time yeah whats know whats think im hearing right answer yeah youve got ears suspect listen music guys know listen music theres actually separate signals sent right ear left ear separate tracks thats simplest possible music people guys movies anymore dont think theres right evan wood movie like past years theater okay good theater different tracks movie youve got speakers left right stage stage thats voice maybe track subway typically listen music multidimensional theres lots data world store able work multiple dimensions data piece data multiple uses metadata want associate picture data actually little color swatches metadata position sound data series pressure measurements metadata theres pieces metadata time second ear channel youre wearing headphones ear going okay frequent use know talked arrays said okay weve_got data array lot times want lot algorithms work data consists going data structure like array multidimensional right heres example going dimensional array went dimensional arrays single loop array array heres pattern use multidimensional array outer loop places youre allowed use single variable letter variable names outer loop going dimension array inner loop j going second dimension array inside inner loop im double bracket syntax print values inside array wanted values metadata print j okay okay lets lets piece data store inside array data game people heard tictactoe okay havent know called culturally specific reference tictactoe game played players start board dimensions player use xs use os turn youre allowed place know x o board open spots goal row diagonal right thats rules game tictactoe write write computer program play tictactoe tictactoe games thats world thats known solved game know means game players play chess yeah yeah essentially solved game theres known strategy proceeding state game theres know high strategy involved right lets way thats tictactoe youre playing like threeyearold threeyearold playing threeyearold win force draw right theres reason lose tictactoe means dumb youre small child right lets gonna write entire program manage game lets lets think check theres winner gonna write little function thing need think representing state game told theres dimensional board position board position board states contains x meaning player playing x x contains o meaning player whos playing o o previous turn ive chosen way writing game ive chosen represent spot period period isnt valid tile valid character game im period represent spot board played imagine game work inside computer essentially youd sure xs os play time somebody puts new piece board need check theres winner need look row need look row row right need find row dimension row second dimension im saying row rows columns okay lets lets thing think going write little function lets lets practice writing loop board dont lets try write loop lets try write little function check board lets try fit figure print board okay heres im gonna im gonna write little adopt length plus plus okay lets sure im getting right values start oh yeah mad didnt return thats okay lets return okay looks correct board thats passed size dimension im seeing indices 0 1 2 okay outer loop working lets write inner loop check sure works inner loop similar condition little bit different going inner loop outer loop im length dimension board remember arrays work java multidimensional array means element dimension erase array thats im inside second write second loop start j 0 continue j reaches length particular sub array thats important minute j plus plus lets print append j whats happening need stick right drag little bit okay looks right okay time ive got 0 0 0 0 1 2 4 j second time ive got 1 1 1 0 1 2 j looks like im indices correct lets lets try value position board board j space ok youll ive got 0 0 sub array position sub array x thats right sub array second position oh thats right sub array position c2 period etc im looks good wanted wanted print little little bit prettier way heres suggestion ill looks sec heres code okay change im printing indices anymore im pretty confident im going board properly instead im printing values inside board replaced print ln print statement thats going add new line means board going left right reach end time inner loop im going start new line print x oh period single line jump slide going ive got nice way visualizing board winner board diagonal winner going check im gonna rid winner change okay theres winner board right want winner actually want run want isnt theres winner know dont know oh got play times right know youre youre playing know child youre playing friends small let cheat right oh bunch times right wont worry right gonna try figure giving board piece code sure people playing fairly maybe depending youre playing supposed identify theres winner board okay know gonna suggestion accomplish ive able display board good start actually want detect row let let change little bit little bit easier starting point guys developing totally valid thing right ill x okay ive got winner going whats algorithm checking board described code work think youre look board try find theres winner gonna try replicate code describe algorithm thats going solve problem yeah okay definitely couldnt hear got pieces like started definitely need clearly need loop array lets lets lets scanning look character lets im looking winners lets problem youre struggling problem little smaller figure solve solve problem suggest way rest okay lets look winners horizontally horizontal winners going detected second loop heres looking heres heres im look character character second character know going found winner right look sec lets try write piece code thats gonna thats going allow okay im going actually dont need inner loop anymore im gonna im gonna print element dimension im okay thats printing leftmost element sub array goes oh oh dot writes oh oh oh dot want lets lets lets board equal board okay right piece code accomplish piece code looking second looking second dimension array looking places value second value value indices 0 value 2 c1 inside second array inside loop loop going know second dimension array looking cases values printing going loop basically says heres place thats true heres place thats true im close extend want im saying character second character win tictactoe true yeah right lets add statement multiple ways check second equal case im going check equal okay close theres problem identifying winners says theres winner second dimension array theres winner second dimension array thats wrong right theres winner board right need fix code bug yeah yeah ignore periods periods indicate space heres question theres space winner array cuz filled pieces player second player heres im gonna multiple ways im gonna value equal im gonna im gonna stop know impossible winner way okay looks good let clean little bit lets print print pretty nice message okay lets lets works eventually im running time game gonna stop soon theres winner soon find winner little bit optimization whats yeah stop looking remember piece code actually supposed return won game lets print result currently returning dot instead im gonna return soon soon find winner dont im good good strategy use return statements apply finish checkpoint machine project certain cases youre writing function algorithm soon know answer stop dont looking return statement okay thats cases winners lets break winner took place game finding winner changed tiles x theres winner spot anymore correctly says theres right correctly think works lets test okay lets add winner second array need check finds thats great lets add like tile okay works right lets lets winner way okay looks like working finished im gonna leave exercise reader homework problem later week heres board winner printed youd xs going code identify im need think code looking horizontal winners looking winners horizontally way printed board need probably need loop look vertical winners need look winners going wanted totally complete need place check diagonals actually going okay things wanted use example point idea testing right youre youre writing code ill guys test cases want sense useful guys working homework problems guys working code think test code typically write code pick inputs know answer chose inputs knew winner check sure program producing right output okay didnt check possible board okay checked couple good job choosing test cases trying pick ones think going cause problem better better continue career computer science kind interesting adversarial relationship youre working software project time right sort jekyll amp hyde thing like write code write tests try break stuff wrote know turn youre adversarial role dont think correctly im gonna find way crash oh found problems things didnt work right im gonna fix swap forth right people write good test suites essentially know hopefully chapter debugging youre reading convinced helped remind isnt stops theres wrote forum theres away chapter book fact write code problems mean bad stop writing code problems okay people interviewed book experienced software developers theyre making mistakes time think mean youve lived cases big outages know big services like amazon web services twitter right companies thousands smart engineers working mistakes time actually lot mistakes noticed catch lot testing stuff like mistake mistakes notice mistakes entire site okay fact making mistakes sign work sign bad okay trust ask core staff im sure happy regale stories problems theyve mistakes david right lets okay want talk important weeks quiz right place easily tripped java right heres example ive got strings initialize new remember nice equality operator worked primitives double equal sign supposed check equal heres problem strings heres confusing strings thats im talking special comment right strings equality operator confusing weird right returns true right way compare strings ive created strings new keyword compare double equals returns false operator think theres simple rule thumb compare objects theres function typically provided called dot equals thats want use test objects equality double equal symbol okay think prepared quiz week good luck wednesday oh comment weeks quiz check style fully operational okay youre gonna lose points youre gonna credit right good luck weeks quiz guys
good song heard okay today start launch second parts class point roughly month exactly month welcome fall way today autumn equinox discovered actually day theres equal sunlight darkness actually later week day called equinox today equinox official beginning fall little bit cool weather gonna start today discussion objectoriented programming going consume month topic builds layers know objects think conceptual addition toolkit write computer programs compute communicate computer objects represent major step forward ability work data thats things thats exciting okay lets started know let sort little bit roadmap rest semester slides advanced main things going talk algorithms weve started talk algorithms guys work problem like reverse string essentially youre implementing simple algorithm thats fine algorithm simple learning communicate computer thing youre struggling right forward semester practice continuing work complex algorithms better getting computer want gonna thing youre actually trying accomplish complicated thatll fun data structure structure data work data objects addition ability structure data weve looked simple ways store structure data programs objects powerful tool actually design types add javas type system alright finally software development principles lot come np talk class time time youre gonna learning primarily work machine project different machine project checkpoints coming things think ive mentioned want reiterate im excited machine project guys semester long project series disconnected assignments actually chance introduce things real software development project normally dont youre little oneoff assignments class example refactoring code learn better way fix code youve written rewrite use sophisticated set idioms concepts thats guys gonna chance mp1 timed objects going clean mess guys zero ill slides alright weve talked know tools structure computer programs breaking things smaller pieces try write functions single thing tested right level forcing test suites requiring write code way test effectively gonna second thing model data model real word entities real world entities typically state know variety different pieces information want know things object systems like javas allow model components real world entities state behavior data algorithms going continue guys document code properly thats thats older emphasized np0 eventually forward opportunity guys use libraries figure okay publish things end class start talking objects kind fun point class places start use right brain roughly speaking exactly speaking brain halves roughly speaking right concerned creativity higher level thinking left logical stepbystep brain level think left like computer right computation things thats listed look things right holistic thinking imagination know dreaming daydreaming right things associated right brain programming contrary popular belief actually activity heavily utilizes sides brain know scan know talented computer scientists talented programmers theyre working im sure sides brain heavily involved objects place actually start choices youre going design things want represent information position space person animal course youre taking university information going store going structure information use effectively design problems theres right wrong answer better worse answers right wrong ways okay java objects begin start expose computer science find kind exciting moment right chance creates things know imagine want represent stuff think start think holistically work war want think youve content primitive types java gave box box want objects allow design types augment java way fit okay object weve started peek looked strength objects concept appear lot programming languages java language centered objects languages object orientation objects programming construct appear python appear im fairly sure appear rust appear types haskell appear places language little bit different system working roughly speaking usually talk object computer price talking combines features object state stores information normally actually powerful features objects starts allow model data complicated data types store primitive types sequences primitive types objects existing know object started popular existing languages concept called record kind way joining multiple types data represent complicated jonathas objects objects general brought second feature behavior behavior level way think state sort like variables behavior sort like functions objects unite things okay think objects gonna_talk questions store state objects allow encapsulate information design objects lot think state want object store store information world trying work program sort functionality provide lets think strings right string object worked java stores array characters thats pretty simple cases state object stores fairly simple gets interesting different behaviors provides strings saw know opened string documentation lot features provide things search contents stuff break smaller pieces combine strings supper different behaviors string pretty interesting level objects kind know objects middle class right talk objects second half class halves half class gonna_talk data structures algorithms level objects point know weve talking data structures algorithms simple way objects unite things objects store data implement algorithms kind core concerns computer science ok heres actual object definition technically im word object little loosely right gonna_talk gonna try precise minutes technically object instance class class represents actual class objects world certain type thing going work object represents instance example person student class individual student instance student right object combination variables functions data structures level says object function variables functions combinations variables state behavior data alright lets introduce lets lets start precise terminology use talk objects class represents particular type object know example write lot haskell summary haskell powerful type system thats important distinguishing features classes java like haskell types type represents type thing world right type things particular type similar way common attributes theyre different object instance class different information theres similar unites means represent class type design class java example class definition essentially creating new type programming language till point weve worked int chars strings longs know primitive types design types heres example object class declaration okay point object class programming perspective difficult conceptual perspective going challenge little bit ok represents particular type java object class definition says im working object thats type person object contain following information alright heres class definition line class reserved words java use define class start special keyword class class like variables functions want descriptive types classes incredibly important descriptive called b idea im calling person clue type information class supposed represent okay block inside block remember said objects classes java unite state behavior data algorithms pieces data method declarations algorithms body class definition contains things contains things look like variable declarations ive got line ill line says person contains piece data thats string im gonna use word refer guess person piece data called age sub type int didnt store double hell good question right know ages actually continuous quaniee lets sorted int design decision maybe particular program important exactly old somebody want know ages year years days hours minutes seconds okay state object stores object type person create store h itll age know maybe know doesnt excite look point weve forced deal single pieces data wanted store information person wouldnt able remotely like store like variable age secondary id remember pass function wanted store multiple people need raise gets ugly im actually designing new type language im saying hey im gonna work data people heres information person program obviously people lot age theres lot attributes want store person maybe particular program im writing choices sort data talk guys like constant chatter coming room like stop thanks right design person class choose data want store person okay following method definition im saying person following thing im establishing behaviors associated class heres behavior function method guys writing homework youre gonna write anymore youre gonna write class youve written right implement algorithms simple right says print persons standard use familiar system got print ln use special syntax going talk minute access object object running method thats look complicated class definitions typically find thing okay talk little bit places things slightly complicated interesting things root complicated classes java typically store pieces data think string string stores array characters piece data looked definition string youd find methods okay class class doesnt represent instance class thats object think class analogy think somewhat helpful try stay away possible class sort like blueprint blueprint house blueprint tells build particular type house blueprint execute faithfully course java youll house execute youre good house right blueprint determines particular type object going structured instance class object store different different age class sets structure instances class required follow person age ok instance object class person object thats type person instance variable thats string instance variable age thats int thats state behavior itll method called print takes arguments returns prints object string things java makes interesting restrictions java makes useful frustrating java particular class youve established youve compiled code cant changes later change instance class person code running cant suddenly decide oh wait think person birthday im gonna add program runs want change actually change class definition recompile code theres reason languages python javascript interpreted languages allow changes like runtime little terrifying cause problems java doesnt allow decide later need model information person change class definition recompile code know example app redistribute new version app think frustrating youre writing small programs turns helpful youre debugging working larger pieces software guarantee instance type person know things know know hasnt okay finally talk new kind know messing couple weeks didnt exactly know going blueprint class definition actually create instance class use store information blueprint says particular type particular class going represent store following data going behaviors actually create actual age object know instance class use object java instance ill use interchangeably object created according particular class declaration said heres person class looks like im going create way create new object use special keyword called new right heres right seven definition person class tells state behavior line im actually creating new instance class class class type person looks pretty similar variable declarations initializations weve seen left im saying java want work variable called jeffrey thats type person variable named variable type start defining custom types use place normal type declaration initialization thats right equivalent int char string right unlike int char need special new keyword actually literal figurative new keyword use word new says java create new instance class class looks like method declaration going ignore going come talk soon wednesday line 8 executes jeffrey instance variable type person set set age right lets try terminology straight important person capital p class type java object jeffrey example instance class object object type person right dot notation know objects combine stated behavior access state behavior youve seen strings rays didnt understand hopefully makes sense dot notation allows access properties methods object instance class line 8 ive created instance class person called jeffrey variable called jeffrey person set persons age syntax line 9 object jeffrey dot instance variables pieces state defined object defined age im dot age set age particular person right ive got literal right ages int thats defined class set int literal set initiai print right lets try sure oh ones wrong ive aged bit ugly happens right set lets jeffrey equal hope like stab thats fine right print try access havent declared compiler error places job helpful try intellij wont let itll big angry red squiggly like instance class person know instance variable food know java makes sure assignments conform right thing im double literal age int warning similar way warning tried set know local variable type right questions going yeah ah okay good question goodgoodgood bit review mean left printing remember goes left method function declaration yeah return type void yeah means means doesnt return avoiding method return try return void method lets try return int going compile try set result lets use print actually lets jeffrey dot print okay oh mad lets rid ah okay actually interesting gonna come second lets set like called print print function thing lets try save result cant right void special type place method declaration indicate method doesnt return cant create variable type void cuz point right cant send actually amusing java let clear voice variables wanted variable called know cant place use void okay want point talked instant primitive types java primitive types building blocks gonna use build complicated pieces data model data know want remind computer scientists know theres buzz data science stuff like okay computer scientists data scientists right thats computer scientist plus stuff right dont forget guys work data time spend rest career working data dont feel intimidated says data okay yeah computer work complex data java primitive types design objects combine multiple instances primitive types turns objects classes contain variables objects nest things class declaration includes instances classes fact saw right person person class instance variables age primitive type object strings objects thats theyre capitalized ive got class combines fields pieces data primitive type class look inside string gonna find array characters promised drill far eventually primitive types start object declaration java break break break follow way youre gonna find primitive types heres example lot cases useful heres example im storing maybe im building program allow people know create schematic furniture room like okay ive got room class thats supposed represent information room program multiple rooms room remember object oh room height width ive decided ive decided represent height width separate class dimension class complicated room height width probably work beginning yeah answer bunch different rooms buncha different rooms height width thats okay thatll work dimensions create separate object yeah whats okay area method room class returned area room good question actually yeah yeah possible things dimension like piece furniture furniture class writing program probably normally start saying okay room height whip separate class piece furniture youre like oh gosh height im starting repeat creating dimension class dimension use need like compute area ill add dimension class sense right need set value inside object use continue use dot notation use dot notation follow object pass know object access know methods variables objects contains lets know happened right good dining room instance room ive declared notice want point thats important motivate little bit discussion wednesday create rid okay ive created instance dining room whats value dimensions going right finish executed lets find okay thinks gonna thinks job automatically gonna set like dimensions object know nice right yeah chop nice ill happens right lets print value dining room dot dimensions okay scary magic value indicates places null trips people uninitialized object variables example forgot initialize dimensions came program said okay whats width room nasty null pointer exceptions runtime error cause crash somebody notice right talk address problem time java objects open type system key type system java java gives starting points primitive types youre races know use objects classes java thats scary unfortunately know grade assignments straightforward practice ive thought little bit dont good solution terms structure class normally design classes gonna tell want dont tell cant test code right okay design person class ive got tell names variables stuff like apologize essentially kind limiting creativity guys express youre actually guys final project real world youre writing real programs lot spend time thinking model data youre working pieces store initialize come know know lot code weve written club support class example talk course developers theyll yeah mean spend lot time designing classes designing objects designing new types right partly lot choices youre know theres autograder satisfy let little bit preview know know think pretty everybody working mp0 graduations write mp 0 incredibly sad function alright maybe writing sad thing thats sad actually write ok tas class like went np like oh gosh good target range like takes like arguments right ok didnt know objects best ok im sorry forced hopefully youll chance fix right method signature particular function awful thing allowed work mp0 checkpoint primitive types want represent latitude longitude position thats fundamentally variables maybe represent high altitude earths surface okay function like array latitudes array longitudes path current longitude current latitude okay clean right know approach known synchronized indices forget soon saw right mean means value doubles associated sorry value latitudes associated values longitude okay want place opening javas class system able design type produces dramatic improvement quality code okay want location type stores longitude latitude piece data world thats complicated series data points okay particular type data hard model needs doubles alright okay sorry theres bug slide let got fixed reload guy oh okay ignore semester okay imagine class design classes know use im starting learn use objects java know use represent complex data represent single series values primitive types ive ive created location class location minimum latitude longitude valid flag right indicate longitude latitude makes sense maybe gave values outside range valid latlong right limits know theres range valid latitudes longitudes create location invalid ones ill check ill set false time look look look cleaner okay remember actually worse array latitude story lunches array path indices guided arrays bearable right instead path series location measurements data googles collecting lot form series location measurements right know usually theres pobably timestamp associated location thats current location thats right dont latitude longitude current lack current law location object know example imagine rest function goes cleanup think mp1 alright level objects data structures right know known records objects know combine state behavior past little okay thing gonna_talk today idea instance method weve talked point weve largely concerned data object store objects things thats things thats fun instance methods class declaration object class perform certain actions implement certain behavior going dimensions class example adding feature dimensions object hey nice dimensions object know calculate area case forget easily seeing new piece syntax lets lets sure works okay like works create instance different dimensions sure working okay good state behavior lets lets lets boolean portrait need able spell portrait ill turn greater height know looking width height long time portrait orientation appropriate photograph maybe right add piece state existing variable right width actually right way height greater width right went working program things needed dimensions able add easily okay let briefly talk special new keyword called saw instance method runs instance instance method instance class instance method runs accessing values variables particular instance class way use keyword called instance method runs refers object okay let lets gonna silly lets called void print width system dot dot print lin dot width sample dot print width thats gonna print 10 let create new dimensions object lets set 20 second lets print second dot print line hope said example second kind second variable perfect point different dimensions objects independent change width doesnt change width let prove music printing width example right come talk little bit oh look awesome right okay come object modeling time wednesday going talk constructors midterm starts today wish guys best luck quick reminder format 12 multiple choice questions code reading programming questions programming questions partial credit arrays multidimensional arrays uses strings string documentation provided cover sheet exam good luck wish guys best luck guys practice problems quiz questions practice problem right good luck midterm mp1 released everybody tonight blue team good luck orange team finishing mp0
welcome today continue journey jabbas object system gonna_talk feature java objects makes useful allows establish relationships kind nice way avoiding duplication programs write eventually talked polymorphism interfaces things powerful properties aid software development right think reflects real world entities know objects java java class javas classes ability java create new types capability thats designed idea working data think things real world know relationships things hierarchical relationships things going start seeing today model relationships java classes data work programs accurately reflects relationships know relationships data find real world right lets talk little bit midterm overall pleased aggregate performance class midterm want look couple practice problems didnt release problem homework access problem practice programming problems available homework 125 practice problem set want use practice future notice problems appeared midterm different forms possible saw slightly different practice problems okay know look midterm look midterm mean aggregate performance class look ok thats fine know 800 individual stories individual assessments let talk minutes interpret midterm score point midterm exam reason appears semester know know colleagues ive talked people like oh know right thing wait til right drop deadline class hard right way fool people problems ball drop deadlines late wont able semester second problem dont want want little bit day possible point semester things arent going thats case want sure fly need help recover decision dont want continue class semester right primarily interpret performance midterm function programming problems multiple choice questions know maybe little bit tricky know missed maybe think thats kind okay missed lot maybe talk thing think diagnostic power decision continue class programming questions heres interpret got good dont need great job nice work midterm good know think thats okay gets acceptable um youve youre gonna succeeding class youre know cleared bar didnt clear like mile know plan continuing semester semester youre going okay got suggestion preparing exams class needs change heres thing thats thats hard tomorrow lab particularly know didnt questions right got right im asking lab tas come talk answers know ive talked students small mistakes thats fine know little error theres little misconceptions need clean know looking code cant 800 happy wants stop office hours point tas able individually tomorrow theyll able look submitted okay youre close youre way think misconceptions need clean thats things gonna lab tomorrow didnt programming questions right know approach staff member ready approached tomorrow lab know dont feel bad want help lot resources class lot staff lot knowledge lot friendly people mean know vantage point guys know hard core staff particularly cas working help right think oh nice somebody patient helped homework problem dont realize youre receiving help homework problem like 30 students receiving help ch rapidly scanning forth multiple threads guiding right direction want help dont want isnt like shame acknowledging concerned performance class want help starts looking assessing kind conceptually class maybe having little bit conversation needs change going hey thats gonna tomorrow lab things okay questions point kind know think suspect know dont sense ebb flow college life perspective feel like know kind thick right right mean beginning semester feels like long time ago thanksgiving break feels like long time hot outside reason probably midterms classes things starting know start typically freshman kind starts pretty easy everythings getting difficult time natural feel little bit overwhelmed questions midterm mp stuff yeah question extra programming questions curate certainly look website guides find places practice cas help forums yeah know asked day admit find happy think unfortunately strangely cs 125 maintain better sets questions objectoriented programming ive able find online theres lot like little leak code questions algorithm design stuff like kind objectoriented stuff youre right theres huge library like wed like forward future place lot questions questions actually produce yeah yeah question distinguish compiler errors runtime errors ill brief answer baby great question forum add little bit detail right compiler errors largely syntactic mistakes java compiler gonna catch things like variables named incorrectly youve got syntax place runtime errors question runtime error quiz typically expect pretty clearly like know classic things pointers right null reference like object thats null try dereference right raise outofbounds loop walks end array sort classic example yeah yeah thats brief answer try answer floor good question okay lets launch left entirely review dont think drove home friday lets lets talking static review week started talking java objects use create types language allow model kind data combining data algorithms combining state behavior java object stores information combine number different objects prot java primitive types provides functions run right instance object static keyword changes semantics variable method thats associated class yeah oh greg okay sorry hows thank normally declare know reasons talk static examples keyword dramatically changes behavior variable method particularly variables know helping students multiple semesters particularly kind weeks homework problems common mistake marked variable static shouldnt marked static mark static right lets look example course class im creating line looks normally like variable instance variable declaration im marking public means anybody access modify having setter gatherer type int count essential value zero ive added static keyword remove static keyword instance course object instance class course object type course count modify dont modify static copy count belongs class dont need create instance course order access instead access directly class line 12 valid code looks little weird da notation weve seen object instances class instances im dot notation actual class youll notice created instance course dont new keyword created course object instead access static variable terminal static variables particularly argue going use theyre common common static methods heres example static method looks similar normal method declaration java line 3 method called print takes arguments returns thats void public meaning anybody use ive marked static function creating instance class pretty reason static methods people static method recently people worked recently okay suspect static method anybody know syntax class capitalized dot function wrong right yeah yeah thats good lapwings told class distance function thats static method taking class youre ideas new create instance lat lang utils use lightly utils dot method common package ive seen np thats thats handy yeah yeah math dot steal math dot abs anybody functions yeah static methods math java class fact math java class actually far know instantiate cant create instance math theres deep mathematicians probably appreciate right cant job instead provides bunch helper methods useful things like computing absolute value computing ceiling function cases doesnt sense create object mean snap object represent java provides libraries programming languages provide use library bunch methods want provide like java create class add bunch static methods methods useful functions reuse code like ceiling function light absolute value function guys wrote functions dont need disease ones built math class common common idea java common way use static functions alright static methods thing point static method instance object dont lose access static methods come instance op example ive called print line 9 syntax class dot function static function wasnt static couldnt playground minute play works instance course function thing guys hello thanks believe actually hear talking thats room works pro con right getting better figuring sound coming right good insistence fact remember meet talked instance methods instance methods access special variable called referred instance class running method methods java instance class cant use theres theres guaranteed instance class use method running heres example little bit confusing lets walk dont right ok line 2 variable instance variable class variable static keyword instance variable instance course modify modify create instance course ive got variable print static function runs guaranteed im actually going course instance able called directly course class access field replace thought id problem problem instance method sorry instance variable print class class methods access instance variables theres guaranteed instance class actually exists going math class cant create instance math class time math dot seal runs theres work based inputs thats useful right math essentially includes bunch helper methods dont need instance object work right theres static variable create static variable copy variable associated course class instance class shares variable useful know heres example potential use static variable told theyre actually useful heres example case maybe argument actually ive got static variable thats type count ive got static variable type int named count initialize zero im im increasing count acts instance course access way useful constructor actually increment variable minute right public private worked way static methods variables instance methods variables theres difference semantics public variable read written private written methods owner class thing public private static methods yeah yeah yeah question static variable static count variable change semantics answer big way let example minute playground things thats tricky static particularly variables throw static variable suddenly classes behavior probably going change static methods know know errors cant answer access instance variables static careful apply variable right work okay lets lets examples okay lets let let actually pull count guy right want want okay lets use starting point actually example come think good okay chuck style gonna angry im gonna fix right good lets review whats whats whats playground ive got static variable named count instance method called print count remember instance method access static variable static method cant access instance variable lets try sure works way think chained instance variable static method actually pretty helpful message compiler says non static variable count referenced static context function print count static cant access instance variables try doesnt know essentially problem dont instance class okay lets lets static lets count static static im good lets lets suggested lets count variable reflect courses created program know program thats managing like grades bunch classes campus like know add course program im going store information want able print like page web page program like heres courses system like okay going yeah yeah know gonna run time canoe course created construct right dont constructor argument constructor need need need add constructive course thats going increment count okay im going actually rid alright let actually little bit useful print land print statement print okay working thought right know write loop creates courses bunch course oh mad yeah okay create courses manually loop creates bunch new course variables im print print static function instance course actually instance course class okay questions fun example right lets experiment need small change program right going compiler problem whats problem going yeah yeah course object count count attached class attached instance class run try compile compiler gonna error saw okay right lets like late night im tired im like im gonna work right im gonna work changing static oh mad ive got change im hacking im trying stuff work okay let power static want longer tracking number courses created reason course count constructor starts count starts zero convince lets little login constructor figure count constructor starts running okay static youll count tracking number times constructor called right ive got prob got problem piece code maybe guys help fix heres problem know im like know im working cs 125 final project partner dont trust know like feel like like homework drops sure want know try like right mess modify count directly wrong rid cluttering output okay count wrong ive access directly class fix problem yeah ah private deep yep work gonna fail right pile erichs cant access lets like rid gonna work yeah heres example case private improves overall sort safety code ive written likely someones gonna mistake person modify count change core code count class right sorry course class know modify source code course order change alright questions know wanted allow access create setters getters things like essentially getter right dont little bit nicer lets create public int public static int count turn count lets instead printing ill rid guy rid guy dont want write rewrite think course having sort special print method im actually created getter count variable essentially read count variable theres setter dont want anybody able change im changing according semantics ive defined classroom okay good know reasons thought bunch times alanna yeah talk static confusing let sense strategies think confusion occurs youre forced work static little bit actually brain starting reckon java objects actually mean fact static causes shared forces think parts object shared versus share create object instance create class instance certain properties properties shares classes example lets extend little bit create public string know actually lets private lets course constructor set right im forced add create courses lets new courses yes oh thatll work yeah course system dot private im gonna create getter lets public string lets print created new classes actually 107 rd sis 101 sis 105 exists 108 cool dont know whats course theyre sharing count confusion sort like having hammer little bit think help solidify mind java objects classes store information okay couple things know sort java keyword bingo point lets cross card final guys seen little bit youve working mp1 final modifier add variable indicates value changed initialize cant changed later program final variables essentially allow establish symbolic constants programs talk little bit form useful people getting magic number errors code okay correct way work problems establish whats called symbolic constant instead having code im trying calculation thats dependent lets im trying write program help sure sleep right bunch calculations im trying sure got sleep maybe sleep getting average week know program needs know youre supposed option stick number code somebodys reading theyre like value calculation denominator computation instead establish kind symbolic constant saying final youve seen variable looks like variable declaration type int looks different talk second value im saying static theres copy true final values public anybody read final cant change final final indicates modified ill minute try modify value thats final wont work compiler catch play names constants java different format variables normally use variables start lowercase letter use camelcase constants convention uppercase think called theres snake case like theres special capital snake case language like python indicates break words underscores capitals think look maybe guys figure like angry snake case theyre capital letters reason like program know know constant kind right someones reading code hours night know got hours night oh computation thats trying figure got sleep right variable nice thing outlet constants lets year theres new research comes says getting hours sleep 10 instead mucking code trying figure time 8 actually number hours sleep change code change hours night seven new data indicates rebuild app good okay compiler enforce right ive established hours night change compiler allow modify gonna complain way change okay final static final questions start talking final particularly difficult wrap mind dont think homework problems week designed practice static know heres way solve homework problems try static try static credit particularly useful right particularly think future like try static try static crashes im demoing ipo company loses billions dollars evaluation right want think whats happening apply keywords code right blindly changes question ah great question mean class final like question im going briefly stop actually good question okay let create class called test im gonna destroy example im gonna test test build new test pretty boring right class ohoh mad okay lets find oh okay chuck stiles mad textile wants public final okay works wouldnt questions means clues finally yeah good segue topic right im gonna come talk mind way want introduce topic pose conundrum mean ask general question youve working impedes encountered hopefully didnt understand behaved way couldnt explain okay good trying travels world computer science moments dont behave way didnt understand didnt expect thing thats dont want happen like bogging fix life theres times theres going theres indicates theres world dont understand let example like right okay ive got public class example remember new examples work start static main method thats defined example class examples class create new instance line line walk line code point variable called lower case example type example theres interesting havent created know incidence variables instance methods im getting started lets try running okay right ignore output output red herring whats confusing challenge idea weve learning far somethings wrong theres line weve discussing yeah yeah great im calling function instance class ive got instance called example good havent created instance methods instance variables use dot notation function string theres function string function string dont work couple things work ones im gonna okay doesnt sense okay based ive told set class blueprint im supposed define class works example class told means string method allowed like semantics like lets try passing variable okay doesnt work error message actually starting clues whats happening okay big topic going start talking today continue wednesday fundamental organizing principles set classes java right simplify code easier understand reason reflects nature real world entities idea called inheritance java class inherit behavior state class okay typically set relationships classes reflect things world right heres example youre going understand couple days im declaring class called pet kind normally pretty weve seen public class pet ive got protected variables come minute essentially instance variables string string type instance method called print essentially prints formatted message type console line new place introducing new terminology new syntax allows work effectively javas class system javas object ma line im creating new class called dog understand public class dog public anybody use class im setting new type language dog capitalized capitalized classes comes new keyword highlighted purple like keywords extends pet extent establish inheritance relationship java essentially mean means dog wants inherit state behavior pet im going extend class im saying im gonna use classes blueprint starting point class want add stuff want establish know certain semantics works dog class right doesnt actually add variables pet provide constructor sets type pet properly type pattern okay thing inherit type pet class youll constructor im studying type declared instance variables class reason use theyre declared pet ive declared class dog extends pet inherit public protected behaviors pet example print function print defined pet instance dog method im inherited state behavior parents right lets establish terminology quickly run time today java create asset establish inheritance relationship extends keyword declare class allowed declare extends class different languages languages support multiple inheritance java okay class extend class inherit public state behavior public protected instance variables access public protected methods access private stuff come flush ive ive created classes inherit pet dog kind pet cat kind pet quibble dog actually species wild creature creature dogs pets dogs pets definitely wild dogs want pet thing cats right cats pets im sure people disagree want cat pet cats people think nice pets theres cats clearly good pets gonna model app know help know set care peoples pets right theres couple startups trying today establish inheritance relationships classes terminology use pet parent dog cat dog cat pets children okay establish multiple levels inheritance java time think later week look tree data structure visualization allows little bit clearly case dog extends pet mutt extends dog mutt type dog type pet mutt inherits dogs behavior instate dog inherits pets behavior state relationship transitive mutt inherits behavior state pet dog okay right refer dog pet mutts ancestors refer dog mutt pets descendants determinate terminologies drawn family treats right okay think im um im little cell type think ill come protected time okay actually know minute ive started protected slide intention protective goal protected allow access variable method determined inheritance relationship public anybody read write variable private methods find class protected variable read written descendant class methods class methods classes descend class protected actually little bit complicated ill finish wednesday continue talk inheritance right couple quick announcements coders chapter weeks quiz chapter 4 week im confused easier questions replacing right autograder working check scores mp1 appreciated round applause autograder god coders guys
hey everybody guys lovely weekend beautiful wasnt chicago beautiful day today great day slow minute stuff finish week particularly polymorphism topic continue look future clicking thats okay dont discouraged going talk little bit polymorphism today reminders change view particular type java object implications looking objects different ways right looking object capital o object right gives allows things look specifically instance actual class created features come view okay thats gonna today problems end kind know slowdown break object review sort class thing want want talk know people frustrated people frustrated recently class np okay good let let talk little bit frustration feeling experience accompanies thing want experience class learning easy learn new things reading interesting study experiments physics class harvard actually found students perception learning actually inversely correlated actually learning know reason know teach class somewhat traditional way im talking things sound easy nice chris clear hope thats goal sit homework problems mp stuck frustrated know want understand thats moment new knowledge entering brain thats moment new information taking root right youre building new mental pathways going future thats good news okay bad news hope know guys reading coders youre getting sense frustration goes away field profession world guys entering living years 20 years feel know fairly regular basis know work things people specifically frustration programs able things work sense easy started got hard ugly gross things didnt want system work trying build okay dont moments dont want spend time guys feel frustrated guess coping strategies share know frustrated going feel frustrated think guys helps yeah yeah break break break mp entirely work got classes little bit homework know write email old friend home know check social_media 15 minutes thats okay theres way taking break kind step immediate problem youre trying solve try think little bit kind trying accomplish didnt better way approach learning im sort goes actually great story tell lets lets happens courses took got hooked programming intensive course computer operating systems bad study habits dont encourage replicate set aside like entire night week work assignments class known extremely timeconsuming programming lab plan morning good idea right way need stop break developed habit bad habit im gonna exactly probably guess good habit develop im encouraging habit developed forced periodically chair walk basement ground floor step outside fresh air like 10 minutes bad thing right theres new ways like cool right yeah good clearly good right finding dont break helpful know lot times find thinking okay know gets unwedge right problem new way thats nice thing dont develop bad habits associated cup coffee years thats better better original cup tea people deal feeling frustration im know reasons talking like said prepare future doesnt stop ends youre going continue experience life coming good habits good practices dealing important idea suggestion obviously wrong answers yeah ask help yeah post forum come office hours know fun people realized semester fun frustrated somebody frustrated right maybe person youre frustrated maybe ta maybe im helping forum find frustration buddy sort funny right sense camaraderie right youre youre going reasons im spending minutes talk today feeling stop youre feeling frustrated time time dont assume thats dont know youre dont assume thats youre bad learning actively learning youre cruising going great thats youre applying stuff know stuck means youve encountered dont know learn youll practice time itll hard time itll little bit easier time wont notice okay good lets talk polymorphism started talking time met wednesday anjaanas object model allows look instances classes multiple different ways term polymorphism general term programming languages general definition idea provision single interface entities different types looking look java objects behave different ways depending context actually instance broader idea actually example today youve seen polymorphism didnt realize looking didnt looking gonna look instance polymorphism youre familiar future talk generics like month youll form polymorphism exists java lets talk classbased polymorphism remember dont inherit explicitly class looked week inheritance relationships java objects establish extends keyword allows inherit state behavior class actually powerful theres lot cases multiple classes share similar functionality duplicating class class b refactor code theres single class inherit contains common state behavior need inheriting class customize things want add new methods new state saw week dont like way parent ancestors defined particular method override class definition provide implementation works differently restrictions exactly override things alright sort lot desirable features javas class model java object actually capital o object java object actually thought instance different types potentially type object created adds capital l object particular small inheritance relationship ive established slide class called pet pet extend explicitly class means extends capital o object second class called dog extends pet pet adds print capability class pet provides function called print returns arguments prints string console kind know silly example dog overrides method dog inherits method pet didnt provide implementation method printed im pet ive decided specific kind pet provide implementation says im dog okay pat object dog pet thought morphed pet object treat pet object dog actually morph different classes act like dog act like pet act like capital o object java objects morph considered instances ancestor classes way capital object okay mean practice okay theoretical point time saw object java want morph object automatically morph capital o object java object treated like capital o object java automatically places time saw mysterious hadnt seen didnt understand print function ive signed understand modifiers mean public static void belongs class doesnt return arguments anybody takes argument type capital o object print calls string method capital o object okay far similar stuff weve seen fact code line 11 12 actually run experimented time playground saw works strange choochoo capital d dog object cat capital p pet shes object pass function takes capital object argument java automatically morph capital o object inherit object works slides work fine okay know heres thing want notice important im calling string default string implementation remember produces looks like class followed sign followed thing looks like memory address random sort hexadecimal string dog decided know wrote dog class decided didnt like default string implementation shouldnt rarely useful overrode class provided implementation string matches default object signature takes arguments returns string public doesnt return string dog heres whats_interesting passed print casted object string im print method im getting dog string implementation object thats passed dog time pass dog dog string application second time pass pet pat hasnt overridden string public string string return im pet youll ridden string limitation im treating like object morphed object purposes able past thats print method doesnt mean java forgotten kind object actually instances retain types pass morph type java object look purposes function thats object java knows dog knows pet use figure string implementation use print runs okay thing heres way gonna sense later week talk object references think working follows line create variable called choochoo type dog ive defined dog class extends pet extends object create new dog variable named choochoo line line whats gonna sense later know places theres like circular reference java cant away im im saying okay lets create new variable called choochoo object thats type object ill assign choochoo variable thats type object print im gonna dog print string method okay thing thing thats interesting print ln dont string object itll im passing object choochoo look chew like pet point print line pet object time im im getting string method thats overridden dog morph dog object pet extends pet object extends class extends object like java class java remembers dog ok essentially form casting remember cast talked casting different primitive types thats int cast double like casting primitive types rules cast java objects cast java objects ancestors java object freely morph ancestors dog treat dog like object having special want cast object lets thats object know actually dog need work clear possible going unsafe look example minute line 9 new piece syntax right line 9 im creating new dog left im saving variable type object line code im cast im taking thats actually dog im saying im gonna work object print object thats gonna work want lets want treat pet pet types object dog morph object variable want treat pet cant automatically explicit cast right line 11 ill minute doesnt work know chuchu dog dog inherits pet pat types choochoo morph dogs formed morph right work okay right im gonna print choo choo beginning dog object im gonna downcast pet line 11 im gonna downcast choochoo dog line 13 okay explicit cast wrong example causes fail thats object know wrote code object actually dog know safe cast line 11 know safe cast line 13 example break okay choo choo choo choo dog hes instance class dog behave like dog behave like pet behave like object classes work class work java morph string okay lets try lets lets change line 13 okay im gonna treat like string work runtime error okay errors youre gonna start work morphism says class cast exception says dog cast string right cant know different classes choochoo morph morph dog morph pet act like object strings list theres way thats dog force behave like string know degree makes sense right choochoo dog doesnt array characters theres way behave like string okay lets lets uh lets onward want jonna provides features working polymorphism inheritance runtime things like safe okay youll start equality methods java going start guys write equality methods java classes determine objects actual type lets pass object know actually capital o object java provides keyword called instance allows test particular variable instance particular type java class ive got set know similar weve typically weve talking inheritance dog pet class dog cat extend pet im creating objects dog cat im gonna treat like pets variables tight pack question find know dog dont wants cat pass function didnt know use instance operator variable actually instance dog thatll print true test pet print true obvious im treating like pad type object return false allows determine particular variable particular object youre working morph certain type java class allows things safely example choochoo instance string going mad treat like spring oh dont dont angry thicknesses right right heres example lets lets test shoot choose string going print false oh know got use java find string right okay yeah know theres wrong example alright lets alright throw end class time want sure know dont opportunities class actually look theory heres right chance connect piece theory programming languages work chance recognize know great living computer scientist theres principle job adheres write java type system class model adheres called substitutability idea lets look carefully s subtype t okay world means s extends t right s subtype teeth objects type t replaced objects type s altering desirable properties t okay mean theoretical definition kind slow try sense says job class extends class objects parent replace class extends class goal shouldnt know lose desirable properties parent class reason java classes inherit features parents ancestor classes okay things thats interesting heres example java object talk later class data structures gonna build like lists hash maps things like gonna couple methods know java object going inherit capital object string string use lot examples practical sense doesnt turn useful debugging theres ones theres equals theres hash code turn extremely useful talk hash code going allow build data structures java use store type java object dont need know data structure need know object java java object features substitutability practice means build generalpurpose list eventually know guys upset limitations java arrays dont blame eventually later couple weeks month gonna build list guys gonna start problems working javas builtin list classes classes store type java object reason substitutability talk maps right super useful data structure store java type java object reason subject build reason java object inherits small number desirable features capitulo object capital object replace object inherits java maintain features instance talked started class talked polymorphism said design principle manifests different ways java theyre actually think maybe different types polymorphism java called subtype polymorphism right know java objects going provide string jeffrey yob java object implement little bit differently theres guarantee theres flexibility exactly things work okay level looking different behavior job object string happens determined actual type java object im calling method weve seen like similar information passing know know writing code providing context ive seen case java different things behave differently guys remember yeah yeah function overriding remember guy potentially different behavior depending case arguments case know usually use functions want behave similarly right functions called sum actually doesnt sound know product confusing write different versions sum want work differently provide different arguments thats java distinguishes second type polymorphism subtype polymorphism single method act know particular type class right single method string called descendant object method overloading method behave differently depending arguments provided type polymorphism look java java called generics end okay questions point examples yeah oh yeah okay great question know ask question good question question whats distinction overriding overloading java overload method providing multiple implementations different arguments override method ive inherited ancestors providing method takes arguments understand confusing right overloading like want different versions defined class overriding object find string implementation isnt good information like provide tries print im gonna override method youre gonna confuse im gonna try true yeah great question okay lets couple recent homework problems quickly spend minutes like classic cs 125 problems favorites alright getting point class fun point right gonna ask guys designing classics pretty halfway homework problems think think week started number 33 think like 65 66 halfway homework problems class design homework problems know thing encourage know approach read right literally like bits pieces structure emerged description find public class flip okay ive got line code public class flip single public instance method called flop okay ive got public flop dont know returns sends returns boolean okay public boolean flop alright arguments nope okay line object right gives information itll tell constructor alright need constructor takes boolean argument capital flop flip capital flip takes boolean argument sets initial state flip instance gives clue state class needs store things going going frustrate complaints quiz questions coming problem like typically tell state store tell object behave didnt store single boolean state know thats thats figure particular instance theres big clue says takes boolean argument sets initial state flip instance theres strong clue problem write initial state class story consist bully general going tell state class set thats figure design thats kind whats fun problems honest told exactly state store manipulate pretty like translating english description code alright lets flip alright ive got little ive got example code set able run minute like said ive got public class flip comes find public flip single instance method instance method called flop takes arguments returns boolean public boolean flop lets lets fill dummy value right need constructor constructor called flip syntax constructors generally constructor boolean argument im gonna initial state set initial state im getting clue initial state okay right ive got constructor takes boolean sets initial state class need figure flop says flop changes state false true true false returns new old state class created true flop return false change true false return new value return true essentially toggling things forth true false going im gonna state equal okay know write differently probably know concise way right wrote little bit testing code kind try sure things working okay things know suggest think youre type thing making sure know guys working homework stuff like use playground want problem mean know cares guys write code eventually prairie learn use playground youre working stuff like supposed act independently test ive created ive created flip instance called flip starts true ive created flip called flop starts false iteration loop im calling im printing result coleen flipped flop flop flop fun feel like im seuss fun problem try talk okay lets look instance comment okay initial state flip true time false goes forth false true false true good lets look flop initial state false time true gonna rotate forth control important use different instances testing mistake cause trouble week talked particular java keyword dangerous makes big difference behavior problem java keyword look like things working yeah static right lets happens ive decided like chaos mayhem lets throw static hey works awesome okay looks good lets flop looks good edit random parts code lets look flip looks good im good right happens look problem lets look happens flip flipped flop time wrong value right im supposed false initialize true im getting true true time okay let fun let flop dot flop print result clearly broken right im getting value time dangerous things static lot times itll code look right theres instance class soon theyre sharing state ways cause behavior incorrect okay good little warmup lets im gonna labor definition guys knew guys guys saw writeup lets work okay im gonna sketch bones description okay need comeback need add method im gonna need method returns array ill return null compile okay oh let let look let point common mistakes people okay heres sorry flip flop let forward whats state need tell state needed state class need minimum piece state class store yeah array integers im gonna hardpressed remember integers array 10 integers lets lets im designing 10 ill initialize 10 ok heres thing people kind like said ok im gonna array im gonna values equal 0 use equal new value right essentially im going im going array im looking 0 thats im gonna new value im passed common attempt approach problem doesnt work hasnt contributed today wrong supplementation work work setting yeah think yes okay theres question happens end lets nonzero values happens dont story yeah okay theres wrong fail yeah problem description couldnt add zero array im allowed add zero add integer want imagine value right thing spot second value zero code going end right thing going second spot index array youre gonna overwrite value theres value heres problem way distinguish parts array contain valid data parts dont theres special value stick array thatll allow figure based value position position occupied right got away autograder able away right chose like big value like right maybe got lucky okay zero definitely didnt work right maybe filled array like massive value autograder didnt randomly choose value got lucky okay general going work telling hinting problem array cant figure values okay overwrite essentially dont know values added array cant figure looking whats array add 10 zeros array expect 10 zeros need asked type class design problems going piece information theres missing missing piece genisys solution totally design step right direction yeah okay right track um im adding number time like youre going response need need piece state gonna store yeah yeah essentially need class needs remember value theres actually ways problem remember value remember youre gonna value right work okay addition values need index im gonna use index store place value starts zero thats line im going use increment right time finish wednesday probably lets discuss forum good luck weeks quiz questions coders chapter 4 ooh guys
better okay great heard football team unusual weekend exciting congrats today entering new phase class weeks left roughly change time start digging sort deep conceptual heart pewter science brought speed imperative objectoriented programming skills need bootstrap discussion gonna start cool stuff look forward day guys dont know whats coming maybe dont point things start fun material start talk little bit interesting think core computer science material differentiates computer sciences programmers deep conceptual concerns field tools skills deep questions interesting problems interesting things think great way practice imperative programming skills objectoriented programming skills guys developing past weeks today class going talk algorithms data structures thats essentially going end semester quiz week interfaces cbt f starts today week midterm exam objectoriented programming thatll cover second sort unit class point start work algorithms data structures talked beginning class havent chance gonna things gonna talking starting today know think computer science conceptual discipline intellectual pursuit right core right algorithms data structures solve problems methodical systematic way computer replicate right know algorithm sort problem solving strategy replicate implement computer right especially know look word history word history usage word started time computers started solve problems algorithm specific set steps process solving problem things know hard distinction draw right guys said seen java thats programming language going use rest semester promise wont drop python ruston going fun difference algorithm implementation okay going implement bunch know interesting data structures algorithms java java implementation algorithm algorithm lives outside code code reflection steps algorithm prescribes code translation algorithm java write python c d mean algorithm actually find websites know classic algorithm implementations algorithm like programming language known man algorithm set problemsolving steps talk algorithms im know looking java code want guys try remember talking series steps solve problem happen implement class java doesnt thats result fact thats language guys know little bit point okay computer scientists frequently implement algorithms thats going start thats guys gonna thats guys gonna downstream courses gonna learn algorithm properties abstract talk algorithm outside implementation gonna implement algorithm imperative objectoriented programming skills guys know know simple calculations sort building blocks talk algorithms simple math store results simple decisions conditional statements right imperative programming class repeat steps extremely quickly repetition tools building blocks algorithms going talk okay data structure class know gonna_talk things kind kind im going bounce forth algorithms data structures feel comfortable depending things want talk right data structure computer science collection data weve structured particular way weve seen data structures algorithms weve seen data structures weve seen raise raise data structure complicated data structure simple data structure data structures come new ways working data stored data structure thats structure data certain ways talked trees example talked binary trees binary trees going ability implement new algorithms accessing data thats stored inside tree list implementations start working end week going different ways accessing data inside list different tradeoffs terms time takes perform certain operations data structures know essentially going going lean objectoriented programming knowledge weve working past month going primitive types combinations objects build build data structures going talking list tree okay utilize existing data structures like arrays appropriate references big month okay reasons talked references talked objects know particular unfortunately lot objectoriented content class maybe structure differently maybe structure better lot like lot machinery werent sure getting point class going talk machine topics know highly complementary know dont think able teach data structures course course data structures data structures algorithms data structures shouldnt able course design algorithms course algorithms algorithms algorithms data structures okay implement algorithms utilize specific features data structures order work implement search binary tree exploiting structure tree order search efficient thing data structures data structures guys learn learn 126 learn 25 dont exist somebody thought cool hey lets tree trees pretty store data itll pretty know trees nice know theyre particularly time year change colors nicely know somebody data tree potato tree things data kind cool okay chance bring imperative objectoriented programming skills weve learning use cool okay way sorry surprised slides way gonna introduce new things alright going introduce new machinery weve talked algorithms start talking today particularly new objectoriented concepts going talk generics gonna_talk little bit features java object model come handy start work data structures operands okay lets things want point guys know perception know think listening students talking today know think guys misconception interesting problems computer science kind solved know guys showed late born late know people got earlier cool stuff theres left work truth couldnt farther right past couple decades weve seen massive advances computer science fueled new algorithmic techniques ill throw think know people noticed like google know picture cat upload picture cat google knows theres cat photo right like mean sort like thats little bit weird right google bunch big data centers people sitting like cat cat cat cat cat cat cat maybe cat cat cat computer computer algorithm algorithm enabled algorithmic advances extremely recently deep learning core deep learning algorithms enabled algorithmic know algorithmic invention happened relatively recently algorithms technology possible recent discoveries area algorithms dead field interesting left lot cool problems example place know change new idea new way things gave birth entire beautiful field new cool stuff right lot ai guys work built models trained particular technique okay lets talk simple solved problem right honest actually come talk hashing computer security little bit end semester kind open problem actually working space actually interesting open problems ok heres example algorithmic problem right integers want find greatest common divisor greatest common denominator given integers number largest number divides integers evenly okay actually extend idea talk gcd pair integers extend set n integers whats largest integer divides n emailing okay online find know wikipedia page gcd incredibly detailed interesting example solve problem variety different algorithms called euclids algorithm goes long time close solve problem okay implement want want use example talking little simpler im gonna come distinguish end class okay know like know somebody puts board youre interviewing company look dont want super efficient solution problem essentially like fizzbuzz type problem want solve okay dont worry long takes want solution gcd okay memorize euclids algorithm impress interviewers right lets lets think solution going work right category solutions start talking guns known brute force solution okay resist bringing review papers mobile systems author use term brutal force instead brute force theyre talking brute force brutal forms okay trying kill problem right goal execute problem right brutal force brute force right mean kind like know need solve problem try harder like force im said dont force thats gonna algorithm analysis brute force actually specific meaning okay meaning basically try possible solutions find solves problem assumes way checking candidate satisfies requirement problem statement gcd way checking gave integer gave set integers said introdu bide evenly figure use modulus operator remainder operator java test particular solution okay brute force solution problem says lets gonna numbers potentially possibly solution gonna going try okay order mind doesnt work problem need need way checking solution correct okay dont know pick good numbers right check number dont know ones pick opposed ones void okay heres thing approach im raising dont want guys think im like philistine im raising observation warning okay computers gotten know obnoxiously fast guys access mean true right things know gratitude journal write today im grateful powerful computers right know phone pocket literally powerful super computers maybe 20 years ago actually true right changing world ways cant begin understand guys beneficiaries youve got access horsepower thats good means dont need sophisticated solution solve problem okay youre getting started problem comes system program youre trying write system youre trying build reasonable thing try simple try simple thats easy understand easy reason performs okay slow implement sophisticated look certain companies involved time know know twitter started dumb things got big popular fixed things sophisticated alternatives allowed site work better okay right lets lets example okay ive got simple math class avoid colliding math class thats existing lets declare method called public static int gcd going integers lets return zero think chuck style gonna oh yeah okay fine fine czech style youre gonna win defeated creations okay alright ive got little method skeleton alright let let lets actually lets actually lets public static lets lets helper function lets private boolean check int second divisor n right want check function return true n divides return false dont know n greatest divisor point want figure divisor maybe divisor alright implement helper function ive got integers dont worry air checking main function yeah yeah jabez remainder operator careful actually modulus know know guys sort review right lets lets return 0 lets remind operator works remainder second angry right modulus operator java returns remainder number divide number divided second look thing thats printed right 10 8 2 divide 10 8 2 left okay okay use remainder operator determine number divides number evenly value return 8 divide 10 evenly value modulus return remainder operator return number divides number evil yeah zero bingo okay lets return modulo n equal 0 second im kind sorry saying modulo remainder ill nice parentheses pretty okay theres check function like said order apply brute force solution need ability actually check things efficiently isnt line code fast know going slow check things quickly okay right ive got starting point im obviously way checking apply brute force solution problem englishlanguage description im gonna way checking value values want find greatest common denominator maybe maybe way start whats whats smallest number greatest common denominator greatest common denominator numbers whats called relatively prime dont share factors ones greatest common denominator whats largest number greatest common denominator numbers smallest right bigger im going divide small small okay lets lets smallest equal second smallest equal second okay heres little snippet code im declaring local variable called smallest im setting smaller second im applying brute force search technique actually need easily smallest lets birth definition brute force im gonna systematically enumerate possible candidates thats loop possible candidates numbers greater 1 greater equal 1 equal smaller numbers want compute gcd gcd ok im going im going check im gonna divisor second return n ok lets try ive got ive got ive got concerns oh need static thats correct ok uhoh doesnt look right whats problem yeah yeah want find largest value smallest okay observation im starting fact know exactly whats gonna happen going work divisor need need turn loop lets lets start smallest value lets continue great imperative programming review greater lets work okay looks like thats reasonable writing library actually gonna know writing assignment use test cases okay whats correct greatest common denominator aids right doesnt work doesnt work seven dont work okay 150 case greatest common divisor numbers good test case sure algorithm works properly 50 actually greatest common divisor kind obvious 50 times pulled numbers relatively prime okay intuition breaks little bit whats thing set alarm bells answer wasnt numbers dont run lets changed okay expect dont know exactly result answer possible answer im gonna argument yeah yeah theyre right ends 8 ends 0 good old know elementary school math numbers answer cant smaller 2 bigger turns common factor okay good heres obligatory sort know hulks life bruteforce algorithm lets identify different parts based definition im going systematically enumerate possible candidates thats chunk right right im gonna check candidate satisfies problem statement ive actually written check isolated separate function look buccal algorithm smarter right particularly small cases know small program wasnt important okay right right good thing doubleedged sword partly computer fast gonna know lets lets look right sense describe slow mean slow right means youre okay means fooled thinking solution problem going come bite future right gonna rest class going talk ways sideways going start learning categorize problems different complexity classes based behave problem gets harder harder talked algorithms solving problems rest semester things going consume guys 173 225 big computer scientist understanding algorithm performance order understand algorithm performance need language talk right eventually matter speed eventually matter reasons problem starts bigger wrote function search record lets list looking item list worked great test cases passed fast long list 50 items know manager google like okay going employ know cloud backend going process 50 trillion items bigger problem algorithm fast small problem gets extremely slow big problem thing happen know like computers fast hard write slow program computer today youve sort accomplished sense like wasting lot compute right like point startup takes youre going actually pay computing power actually reading interesting day number amazons number revenue source know amazon web services crap guys buy online selling computation companies amazon data centers world machines online right dont guys need pay attention online right free guys fire machine cloud start stuff start little startup start machines cloud run amazon heres thing youre gonna pay bill month bill going determine operations computers performed theyre things dumb ways bills gonna bigger profit scrummy lower company business start things smarter ways better customers complain performance youre job interview bring home thats important need impress somebody knowledge algorithms actually real thing right computer scientist people gonna expect know limits solve problems different algorithms perform core challenges space right interview youre like sort list integers oh n theyre gonna like candidate know youve got know thats possible okay long algorithm going right lets think lets computing gcd 4 amp 6 fact fun fun lets im gonna track gonna lets public static int steps equal 0 im gonna steps equal know bad bad dont know thats fine gonna work right start algorithm im gonna reset step count time divisor function im gonna record got called level measure steps taking run algorithm run ill print step count right lets print nice way right right okay took seven steps steps stage step number try numbers try try right started tried seven look seven steps answer yeah oh hello thank right 150 thats got lucky happen right start talk algorithm analysis theres case thats easy case started 50 bingo found answer right away okay thats example best case scenario algorithm gcd smaller numbers find immediately cant better euclids algorithm going better combination numbers heres bad case right look started 65000 270 took 65000 269 steps answer reason let seven table step yeah answer start way numbers know know math realize like dumb sorts numbers skipping way know cant gcd right know good solution right going perform know poorly things bigger depending exactly things work right think general okay hard gonna practice weeks m n lets n smaller m loss generality long algorithm going okay whats bestcase scenario weve seen best case scenario best case scenario steps whats true case m multiple event m equal like constant times n im number try finished whats worstcase scenario started way lets n steps okay average case hard going depends distribution numbers work worst case scenario n steps heres thing n gets big algorithm slows lot exactly close basis modern computer security reason communicate bank safely certain number theory operations long time numbers big start actually true start like went bank website right long bank thats like terrible okay bank going negotiate set big numbers youre going use secure transaction reason detect figure youre communicating incredibly sensitive information takes long solve certain problems youre given big integers okay stuff matters okay 10 minutes left lets fly complexity classes come wednesday okay heres things going come frequently end semester going analyze algorithms mean essentially trying general version gcd want figure long algorithm going frequently going use algorithm category okay ill categories minute dont necessarily want count tiny little thing algorithm want sense whats behavior like lot times dont care specific inputs dont care gcd performs specific set numbers want able general statement performs set inputs thats lot harder inputs tell exactly long going general inputs need think harder long going thats going okay questions going ask particular inputs hard particular algorithm gcd algorithm wrote numbers relatively prime share common factors thats worst possible case start smaller walk way okay best worse average case running time best case looked numbers gcd worst case dont share factors walk average case gets trickier right probably averaging population inputs fully understand okay overall core factors algorithms performance related inputs think simple problem gonna long problem 10 times harder times harder thousand times harder billion times harder long going okay right thats right wait sorry lot times actually talk happens limit m n infinity performance algorithm behave theres reason actually useful understand algorithm performs algorithm performs problem gets hard second reason point little details kind fall away ok let let example im sorry im gonna race algorithm look gcd algorithm wrote theres little chunk code right lines 9 12 thats basically figuring smallest value takes time regardless values okay stuff loop whats gonna dominate performance numbers bigger try small number possible half run time algorithm consumed stupid little calculation stupid important big numbers right algorithm spends lot time racing loop okay thats think frequently algorithm performance limit right point inputs extremely big okay lets meet complexity classes talk algorithm complexity lot times gonna try going trying figure category theres things need figure n whats feature inputs drives performance time second thing category algorithm okay know guys gonna start things like o n algorithm versus oh n squared okay heres matters want want point performance know operations think runtime okay size input graph labeled called complexity classes long varies differently right lets lets start middle actually lets sort right whats called one57 line alright thats bad completely compare like guy okay o n squared long algorithm takes varies size problem difficulty problems squared problem times harder algorithm takes times longer right worse cases weighed actually going talk oh actually know lied o n factorial algorithm talk fun okay oh n factorial look like rocket ship taking bad way okay like imagine wrote deployed product service okay looking new job right soon soon type load starts system heres thing okay cautionary tale graph look okay right origin look problem gets little bit bigger mean time like like owens factorials graph like peace im im going moon run simple test cases dont understand algorithms actually perform actually come o n factorial algorithm think good think oh great ill know push today test cases passed problem im good easy fooled powerful computers use small inputs kind cool slow know youre_seeing big differences know oh square gone right algorithms faster okay im gonna skip come time want right okay let close right crap okay heres graph want impart importance topic sophistication gain computer scientist understanding right heres difference know heres talk algorithms dumb algorithm makes easy problem harder okay havent talked bet algorithm talk time tests array sorted implement algorithm o n squared problem category oh n ive harder algorithm takes longer needs wasteful right computer scientist know guys know end semester contrast advances day come smart algorithm clever way youre actually taking hard problem making dramatically easier right way finding greatest common denominator oh n thats actually category based minimum potentially walk way euclids method log n lets look complexity categories right heres oh end heres oh login login cant o log n log like hanging xaxis alright engineer youre stupid gcd implementation use ooh lets algorithm look time youre wasting time customers spending waiting site refresh know time youre billed amazon time know demo loading slowly youre pitching vc ok wednesday gonna come complexity classes carefully dont office hours today wednesday good luck orange team whos finishing mp2 tonight guys wednesday enjoy lab
hi come everybody welcome new season apparently hope everybody enjoyed halloween doesnt matter tempted dress today callings kind wednesday semester maybe year thats chance alright today gonna talking recursion introduced idea time theres concept thats programming strategy today gonna look recursive approach solving problem simple problem figuring nodes binary tree schematically review time actually gonna write piece recursive code fun essentially kind thing gonna week little bit longer homework problems today start tree recursion gonna continue pattern guys gonna maybe little tired writing tree recursive algorithms great practice recursion things know particularly new think understand need different ways kind starts click whats actually happening okay good news class midterm congratulations better semester better year actually happy new mp checkpoint release weekend thats gonna game comes know opportunity drop mp hope wont hope youll complete process actually point fully functional snake game playin use guys finish think kind rest semester works weeks thanksgiving mp checkpoints gonna consume youre machine project gonna started final project lab week thanksgiving start discussions identify partner goal time want cool final project work thanksgiving okay know whats happening know month half left class week thanksgiving theres quizzes midterm midterm comes right thanksgiving break final project fair need set date soon know whats happened okay lets review tree terminology time started talking commonly data structure computer science called tree tree consists series nodes organize structure particular way node parent node root node root node tree node doesnt parent node tree linked parent node node doesnt store reference parent thats way think node parent parents general tree talk zero children trees work class primarily theyre going children special case tree known binary tree review quickly terminology refer talking know essentially look tree individual node parent children node children children descendants parent child think reversing arrow reference parent node roots okay children parent node divine tree parent root refer tree way look course invert diagrams work refer node tree parents root node algorithms going use going start root fact shouldnt binary tree class going look today working week information stores tree reference root node sort similar saw linked lists list data structure stored reference start item item linked list tree stores reference root nodes find starting root start root find root nodes children find childrens children stuff like rest nodes tree labeled nodes nodes children refer leaf nodes tree nonempty tree root non negative treat leaf node tree node root leaf tree node right didnt tree infinite size right talk depth tree depth depth determined talk sorry depth node tree depth particular node determined hops takes root node node root node thinking nodes tree children root depth takes hop root notes nodes tree higher depths takes longer reach started root hop note level second hop note level leaf node hops level height tree maximum number steps takes reach leaf node guys actually write algorithm compute couple homework problems given tree figure height essentially need find leaf nodes figure leaf node took longest steps reach okay lets start looking recursive algorithm tree presented time didnt implement today talking know good starting point good starting point recursive solution algorithm extremely elegant simple couple lines long conceptually little tricky figure works lets walk going approach problem recursively designing recursive algorithm writing recursive code talking problem solving strategy counts number nodes tree recursively heres general approach designing recursive algorithms step algorithm need couple things thing problem smaller problem big solve know problem smaller solve smaller problems come solution firt problem thats thing theres certain point reach algorithm cant problem smaller ive problem small possible means reach leaf node reach yeah reach leaf node needs reach tree come action minute point problem small shouldnt need smaller solve point solution evident thing ill need figure way combine results smaller problems combine solution bigger problem things algorithm problem smaller solve problem gets small combine solutions smaller problems solve bigger problem eventually solve bigger problem right im gonna break problem know rigorous sort designed way eventually gets small easy solve combine solutions simple problems solution slightly simple problem slightly bigger problem slightly complicated problem eventually solve problem started right heres gonna counting okay heres big problem trying solve trying count nodes tree mind dont know nodes reference tree reference node value thats reference root okay gonna break problem smaller subproblems mean heres proposal given tree size tree given node tree size tree thats rooted node need count node plus number nodes left subtree node zero plus number nodes sorry right subtree left subtree left subtree right subtree okay ive actually proposed way problem smaller left subtree right sub gonna fewer nodes entire tree left subtree gonna fewer nodes thats smaller problem right subtree gonna fewer nose thats smaller problem notice ive im proposing way combine results combined adding add nodes right subtree sorry left subtree notes right subtree sure count node thats current route okay heres node thats current route thats know nodes tree idea nodes fives left subtree idea nodes 5s right subtree knew knew nodes left subtree right subtree tell nodes integra tree okay think im belaboring essential step going repeat okay ive got smaller problems count number nodes tree thats smaller original tree tree rooted node tree rooted node 10 count nodes tree routed note 10 nodes tree root node 3 im good solve puzzle right lets lets lets continue okay lets examine smaller subproblems count number nodes tree rooted node 3 okay let try applying strategy dont know count total_number nodes tree know count number nodes threes left subtree number nodes 3ds right subtree add answer problem actually getting easier node 3 doesnt right subtree okay know things getting better let start im restarting algorithm called recursive algorithm keeps restarting pretending seven root tree seven root tree nodes tree trick question ill node doesnt right subtree left subtree number nodes yeah smallest possible subproblem ive solved node children im know like wait okay told count number notes left subtree right subtree right subtree left subtree zero zero know answer right answer okay good lets im thing im reapply algorithm id want count tree tree root node children count right subtree left subtree add im thing ive reached leaf node ive reached problem solve immediately smallest possible subproblem thats solve point cant making problem smaller theres smaller problem solve ive identified smallest possible problem im gonna okay heres second stage write win right recursive algorithm think stages particularly trees sort natural way think think im kind working way find smaller subproblems tree right thing separated tree left half right half smaller original tree im identifying smaller smaller smaller solve combine results kind thats start solve complicated problems simple solutions merge solution complicated problem okay left im gonna solution nodes tree rooted node seven combine solution trees nodes tree doesnt exist zero thing know nodes tree didnt know know nodes tree rooted node heres got know essentially told count number nodes right subtree left subtree know nodes subtree count number nodes tree rooted seven know nodes tree rooted seven got mated said hey number nodes tree root goes okay know nodes tree rooted thing 10 10 said hey count number nodes tree rooted left subtree number nodes tree rooted node right subtree know nodes tree rooted 10 number nodes right subtree plus number nodes left subtree plus im solving complicated problems started trying count number nodes tree knew nodes broke problem counting number nodes tree nodes number nodes tree nodes im ready finish job solutions gone way started said hey count number nodes fives left subtree thats rooted count number nodes fives right subtree rooted 10 know nodes entire tree got said hey theres nodes tree thats rooted said theres nodes tree thats rooted finish job fives root node come nodes tree oh okay questions know hurts brain explain im sure hurts brain look okay forth algorithm code lets implement okay guys gonna surprised hope easy lets look code couple minutes tree structure gonna use lot week okay ive got sort good object review class called binary tree new static field thats type random im gonna explain minute okay inner class called node sort like list remember list inner class called item node tree binary tree node zero children refer left right node data structure stores value remember want store data tree use data later algorithms trees counting number notes data sort irrelevant way store reference object sort kind data want tree right child reference node left reference node constructor created sets value okay line 13 theres lot code gonna gonna add theres certain thats needed kind set tree theres actually recursive algorithm im gonna right thing tree needs know needs reference root node thats tree references stored tree find root find right child left child find right left children essentially explore entire tree right ive got root node heres want look minute dont want explain great detail want guys freaked simple believe okay question purposes running examples need way build tree build tree want able essentially want able add nodes tree want list objects want way add tree order examples sort interesting want able add want carried random tree trees created algorithm contain values array thats passed constructor object values tree theres couple rules things look minute okay added add object tree function called add look constructor takes list object references adds tree teeps keeps calling add add add calls add root node adds new value tree heres add function works takes arguments reference current node thats current place going try add note second value add thats sorry thats current place gonna try add value tree possible note lets lets imagine run algorithm run root note time root null add node right away note add tree root note add note roots left child add node roots right child problem point im know im spot right reach root node ive ive actually provided recursive add algorithm little bit trickier lets look happens inside add function root node null time cut gets called theres root node root node null set create root node creating new node value passed studying root reference note point tree node heres goes random reference random java standard library collection methods random values things ask random ask random random int random double things random boolean gives random yes value random true false half time random boolean going return true im going enter statement half time going return false im going enter half statement half statement heres current node doesnt right child current right equal null add value current node right child thing random boolean false current node doesnt left add node current nodes left child heres things interesting add restart algorithm right subtree current node left subtree essentially algorithm works follows says im gonna try add node half time im going try add right half time im going try add left node doesnt right child thats ive decided ill add right child ill add right subtree node node doesnt left child thats ive decided ill add left node left child ill restart algorithm left subtree recursive alvin right essentially making problem adding value smaller time adding smaller sub tree theres likely space okay thats sophisticated recursive algorithm expect understand right wanted talk quickly right heres gonna gonna write provided recursive string function guys look alright code work creates trees properly add im creating tree integers add interest want tree string function prints values tree lets figure count number values tree want implement size function okay lot times look look string function public string function takes arguments calls private string function different signature gonna lot work trees write recursive algorithm gonna gonna start recursive algorithm root note right lets lets use structure size im gonna create private method called sighs private method takes takes reference node count essentially root subtree want count number nodes okay size im essentially going return size started root right gonna thing havent implemented recursive algorithm okay lets whats went right simplest subproblem able identify point solve problem theres certain tree able count immediate know ive reached point yeah yeah current left equal null current dot right equal null turn 0 im node remember right gets run note close im counting im counting tree node children size tree yeah lets return okay recursive algorithm known base case point continue problem smaller theres smaller problems found node theres children able count tree theres way theres smaller problems theres right subtree theres left subtree okay lets lets heres im gonna im gonna create value let count set size sizes function im initializing count 1 sure count okay smaller problems want solve ok cant count nodes tree know smaller problems want solve met node know node right subtree left subtree maybe right whats smaller subproblems want solve okay size left subtree right lets count plus equals size current dot left okay brain going start explode little bit im function im calling function weird pod theres reason doesnt work right sort like worries aside minute actually okay im function called size supposed count number nodes little comment count number nodes tree rooted current left sub child need code isnt right help run probably going cause problem yeah left subtree lets fix lets current left equal im gonna count left subtree right need yeah yeah cant ignore right subtree right im gonna essentially thing im gonna right subtree number nodes tree routed increased nodes right subtree essentially 1 plus number nodes left subtree plus oh wait sorry thats right count plus equals 1 plus number nodes left subtree plus number nodes right subtree okay im gonna change return count lets went oh man check style guys signed yeah seven right lets look lets look example seven ill look story lets nodes oh thats right okay recursive algorithm recursive algorithm book tell provide input cause crash tell yeah kern current normally im gonna start algorithm current null theres special case yeah way whats okay length zero link zero yeah oh okay lets try root node works youre close heading right direction guy boom happened root null ran algorithm sorry let things closer example code messing ill strings stuff better okay heres problem example root set called size root started root current valid reference lets im going handle case okay good right okay correct thing closely matches talked went diagram questions want slowly stuff stuff totally totally like mean remember dont remember 20 years ago literally 20 years ago semester took programming time remember recursion struggling recursion confused unusual feel queasy weirded little bit type approach okay let lets going characteristic tree algorithms gonna lot nicer okay promised going simple works correct kind kind nice like okay heres im gonna propose right stopping recursive algorithm gets leafs right look code leaf node known base case current node left right child leaf node return heres im gonna propose lets let algorithm leaf nodes reference lets imagine allow algorithm walk leaf nodes walk essentially tree reference tree reference trees right child seven references trees references trees represent tree whats size tree tree node thats null whats size tree rooted zero right imagine ask nodes sevens left subtree answer zero right notes sevens right subtree answer zero heres gonna gonna little lines 56 59 means weve walked end tree got followed left reference root right reference led tree didnt nodes trees size zero let gonna following okay size tree 1 plus size current left plus size current dot right gonna work lets try nodes lets like works okay looks nice okay working lets linger minute think code deleted lot avoiding know right happens current left null problem couldnt size reference wasnt safe point base case reference reference null tree know answer know nodes zero write write algorithm recursive algorithm pleasing way right makes happier computer scientist says nodes tree plus number nodes left subtree plus number nodes right subtree thats exactly worked went diagram difference left reference know left subtree zero nodes right reference null right subtree zero nodes size algorithms size gonna handle walk tree gonna theres nodes right questions typically going write recursive algorithms reason theres nicer right look know look started right started okay deleted 10 lines code gotta recreate replace line code dont want sort encourage idolize code thats short thats actually good actually reading creator python guido im gonna try pronounce apparently went work dropbox dropbox company maybe youve heard apparently dropbox python lot internally dont know know decided work lot python work person created python language apparently things spent lot time encouraging engineers stop writing clever code find code overly clever clear know probably gets longer right stop cute design things right know shorter algorithm better longer algorithm lines code thats easy understand frequently superior case line distills exactly algorithm counts number counts number nodes left subtree number nodes right subtree think clearer formulation gonna future gonna handle null base case figure allow essentially walk tree right know questions yeah yeah yeah question sighs inside sighs answer figure later dont want complicated essentially size inside size behaves like function start root lets lets hard come later idea size root node let let let let example little smaller okay size route heres happens size function starts running running root node root node value 1 gets line says oh need run size function calls size current dot left copy size waiting second copy finish second copy size starts running says um called work gets calls size ive got copies size running im 4 im gonna size dot left size dot right functions going return right away theyre gonna null reference second copy size gonna finish copy size going size right thing going happen theres difference mean want think whats happening internally fine theres difference calling function inside function calling function inside function string right function inside function function gets called work function called function waits complete proceed theres difference fact im calling function sort anomaly thats structure problem yeah sighs methods right idea dont want great question root nodes private tree class going expose structure people use gonna know dont need know implement tree tree ive got leaves ive got nodes good want use ill tell want know nodes inside tree size im calling size arguments right outside class doesnt cant access root node right internally ok want know number nodes tree called size function starts root yeah great question thats overload gonna time right recursive functions alright let guys advice recursion tricky concept hard started takes practice youre going practice youre gonna okay thing write recursive algorithm eventually stop process making problem smaller reach end cant continue indefinitely cant try continue indefinitely program going end okay known base case thats point solving puzzle base case current null thats point dont size im ive walked tree theres nodes count okay problems smaller step step algorithm simmer isnt making problem smaller youre going stop problem smaller smaller smaller eventually point problem thats small solve known recursive step im calling size left subtree fewer nodes tree thats smaller problem im calling size right subtree fewer nodes entire tree thats smaller okay finally figuring combine results ive got line line things solving smaller problems number nodes left subtree number nodes right subtree combining results says number nodes tree rooted number nodes left subtree plus number nodes right subtree plus count right heres heres example recursive algorithm dont want guys think confined trees implementation factorial right factorial number number multiplied number smaller right like talked features heres base case factorial 1 1 thats problem know solve know factorial number number times factorial number thats smaller ive got recursive heres recursive step im calling factorial n minus 1 heres combining results right base case n equals 1 recursive step calling factorial n minus 1 thats makes problem smaller im going 1 hope combining results multiplying current value times factorial number thats small right heres problem reach base case remember stop point ill guys know little problem break today code fail code fail reach base case yeah yeah zero negative number yeah whats gonna happen im gonna okay need compute factorial negative computing multiplying negative times factorial negative right okay compute factorial negative compute factor multiply negative times negative right compute factor negus factorial maybe combining multiply negative negative factorial negative seven right going right going try run code playground youre gonna runtime error essentially men means got kept calling factorial trying solve problem werent making problem small werent getting base case okay pick monday dont announce today hope guys great weekend stay warm new climate good luck finishing mp3 checkpoint guys
okay look minutes late sorry alright today good day happen cool code write gonna talking sorting time remember got insertion sort problem oh n squared run time today goal going look ways better okay sweet right main sorting algorithm talking implement completely today merge sort merge sort nice algorithm sense predictable performance heres key insight underlies merge sort difficult sort things sort raise right thats spending couple classes arrays sorted merging straightforward ive got arrays sorted goal combine single sorted array okay ive got sorted arrays goal combine know hard right case arrays sorted descending order know smallest values essentially look values array sorry look value array value array smaller thing okay second array smallest right second array smallest value second array smallest value long smaller im gonna pulling values okay im array im putting values array value second array value term right straightforward process arrays sorted merge lets implement challenge today terrible day happen typing keyboard gonna adventure okay lets oh god dont know away right like thing going im given arrays job merge guys forgot chance homework week whats step whats thing want going sanity checking yeah yeah lets handle null cases actually handle corner cases handle null handle cases arrays right thing want want equal null second equal null case going return dont values merge gonna return array actually array gonna return null right okay lets arrays gave null right lets null condition means seconds gave array null lets handle case length equal zero want gave null array second okay second know value said dont work array array thats values merge return date yeah return second good okay finally condition gonna im gonna similar im basically gonna rewrite im gonna second equal null second length equal zero return good right ive handled corner cases seconds ive like okay guys gonna find today thing youre finding im terrible windows finally oh okay okay years ago college started having wrist problems switched use dvorak keyboard layout way keys different positions ive like 15 years thats looked like total idiot need type keyboard normal layout im im good alright led key observations helping students touch computer cant type computer im gonna look like right ive handled corner cases need lets actually create array combined combined array lets gonna new array needs big hold values arrays alright ive got combined array loop going combined array kind pull things smaller array im gonna need track small early remember im assuming smaller arrays sorted smallest value array currently index 0 smallest value second array currently index 0 im gonna use variables track ive got loop im gonna combined array good old loop syntax right walk alright ive ive set problem ive got loop thats gonna essentially need iteration loop need pick value array second array copy combined array position im going combined array essentially need need look array second array figure smaller stick ok actually actually conditions im gonna yeah yeah okay yeah exactly lets index second second index means array smaller value right value im currently looking array smaller im gonna pull combined array combined equal index im going advance index im looking value row okay ill stuff second array okay going work lets try right got return statement thats kind saying right hes okay scroll little bit pull right im gonna return combined lets run code happens oh okay ive got ive got array index bounds exception happening line 15 happening right whats happening im trying merge arrays size array size bound exception thy god size explain happened try figure little bit whats going yeah yep yeah essentially point im going okay dont know thats gonna depends know values true race point array gonna values second array gonna think way value combined array arrays okay dont know second problem point ive advanced index resund second index past end array doesnt hold valid value okay essentially way handle set conditions gonna statement little bit satisfying index dot length mean index equal dot length mean somebody hasnt volunteered answer today ive gone ive pulling things time yeah yeah right point im advanced index valid values basically end point im gonna instead im gonna pull essentially cut paste code second point values need second nope stop let fullscreen figure right im gonna right successfully cut paste windows computer find apparently real terrible right time option key wow look okay round applause right arrays values need second array remember second array sorted point im pulling things second round improve stop values second array lets outer loop okay right theres thing need right im handling case array values im handling cases arrays values im picking properly theres case need handle similar remember dont know rays gonna run values yeah arrays im close right ill point arrays yeah essentially piece code second array right second index equal second dot lane means second array pick array cut paste stop cut paste code okay gotten sort gnarlier want actually complicated conditions need handle arrays arrays data need array erase takes second array second array story okay line 21 means race theyll data thats snowing cool need pick smaller bout right im conditional based value item right lets try solved problem array index bounds okay ive successfully merged arrays lets try corner cases defensive programmers lets try case smallest values array array larger values okay sure works like turn sure works im pretty confident right okay questions like hard mean degree merge sort hard implement hard havent actually implemented sorting algorithm weve weve implemented arrays sorted arrays emerge youre going cool merge sort use build recursive sorting algorithm implement recursive sorting algorithm come grab code actual additional code need write point small right questions good sort recursive sorry imperative programming review know things thats conceptually hard little bit tricky translate code okay question actually use lets talk runtime time complexity ok lets look implementation ok steps going talk heres heres algorithm heres implementation algorithm sorry sorry steps require yeah yeah merge arrays size m gonna n okay level think n representing size combined array oh okay combined array going contain n values know function right combined arrays gonna right know values gonna combined array oh n size combined array loop goes array time fancy theres break continue theres nested loops im array axises comparisons constant time operations okay cool thing right theres data dependence right look theres like loop gonna run combined array size times doesnt matter whats second right like insertion sort breaks stuff like going depend data okay worst case o n best cases oh average case owing thats like merge sort predictable right merge predictable hey arrays size combined size gonna oh n demers sort know cases little bit better performance particularly arrays values right general away right way weve implemented dependence values second long going behavior algorithm depends values second runtime right okay ive weve sort worked observation easy merge arrays sorted order use actually build sorting algorithm okay question sorted arrays come right gave stories size didnt tell sort arrays think merge step took choose sorted arrays size created sorted array size ingredients need recursive algorithm way combine results sorted arrays ill combine bigger sorted array im merging results smaller problems solution bigger problem right question problems smaller big problem small start build combined solutions answer property arrays looked talked fact arrays recursive data structures sub array array contiguous section array isnt right right think array values think arrays values left think erase values array left think array value breaking big problem smaller problems whats kind cool know array break lets break pieces im going split half array size create small arrays size n arrays break arrays size whats smallest subproblem know break problem pieces know pieces whats smallest sub problem im gonna stop solve media right know build bigger arrays sorted arrays smaller sorted arrays whats know know big array break smaller arrays array thats sorted yeah yeah ray value sorted okay start array thats value sorted use merge function bigger sorted array sorted right sort rate bigger sorted array continue ive sorted entire array right ingredients need recursive solution sorting cool right problem smaller breaking array parts im going talk runtime merge sort actually particularly talk runtime quicksort wednesday things thats important note size arrays matters merge sort im gonna try break im gonna break arrays equal pieces array size im gonna end size size array size seven equal right important run time heres gonna work gonna break problem problem smaller breaking arrays smaller pieces theyre roughly size smallest sub problem array thats value im md array sorted array size sorted okay ive solved problem created sorted array merge use merge function okay right merge sort base case weve reached array value zero value right happens arrays divide recursive step split array pieces combined result nice merge function wrote right wrote merge know combine results right thing need know im going use example need figure split array order finish job need know step okay implement function guys point far smart implement function lets bother lets use helper function exists arrays library theres library java library contains bunch functions run rate dont important thing arrays java object contain length property dont actually dont methods static methods array argument interesting things example theres use thats particularly useful thats called copy range right copy range takes bunch different types arrays gonna use int copies specific specified range returns reference new array right notice bunch sorting functions right sort arrays right thats little bit thats actually werent trying learn implement sorting going use ones built john alright thing lets lets merge code lets rescue merge code earlier yeah want write know cut paste grab oop undo find ah sweet cozy controlc lets right going cool right lets drop merge great merge code wrote goal use implement merge sort right merge sort recursive algorithm whats base case argument input array whats base case smallest problem know know stop yeah yeah equal yeah input array size im gonna input array dot length equal return input array array sorted okay know kind kind cool need need things basically sort right half half need sort left half right actually lets start left little think left half values array im going sort right half im going merge results okay know merge right essentially lets int equal sort heres im gonna use function arrays library going going copy half input array arrays dot copy range zero input array dot length second im gonna im gonna sort right recursive steps second lets left thats called left half array right half result running sorry got fix im throwing half array think chuck style gonna lets like okay recursive steps im writing little bit longer minute kind happens right remember recursive function im base case dont know solve problem know problem smaller ive ive said dont know sort array zero elements got im gonna break pieces rely fact eventually ill know sort making problem smaller smaller im gonna small sub problems okay point sorted copy left half array sorted copy right half array need finish job right dont know merge sort function works right know eventually sort array sorted arrays containing values array containing values second array need glue come hacen tributed yeah yeah im gonna merge yeah thats wanted hear im gonna merge right merge function takes left right array essentially im im gonna merge left right thats merge function takes know second array returns new array twice values sorry number length times like okay lets actually works oh chuck styles mad hey brackets legal position weird oh sorry yes declaring reference array uhhuh look magic right like said recursive code complicated questions talk little bit runtime appealing following way lets lets return dont create temporary erase return merge merge sort common im combining rid temporary arrays works okay questions recursive sorting algorithm ive got base case statement im combining recursive steps problem smaller looking half input array second half input array im calling merge sort sort im return sorted copy half race copy second half array use merge glue right lets talk little bit long going little tricky getting intuition right lets walk example lets walk example carefully chosen value number right power thats helpful im thinking okay lets think im sorting array values merge think way okay merge step essentially taking array brought problem small small small finally found erases size merge merges arrays size 1 4 arrays size 2 thats 4 oh merges n 2 okay o 8 right 4 times o n second merge takes 4 arrays size 2 merges 2 arrays size 4 ive oh n merchants n 4 right remember runtime merge step depends big arrays oh n merges 4 4 thats oh 8 step ive got final merge takes arrays size array original value center sort okay thats oh n merge n 8 whats_interesting level contributes om right oh set merges n 8 size original array okay merges gets smaller larger im fewer okay ive got o oh n 1o n second went drives runtime step merge level going wet right drives long going number levels right level contributes oh levels o n turns thinking thinking realized 8 8 log 2 3 okay time problem half small bird talked o log run times weve said frequently associated recursive function recursive algorithm end o n log n runtime best sorting win know best sorting algorithm worst case right implemented sorting algorithm sorting algorithm find worst case certainly islands lot better best case better achieves optimal performance time right heres visualization sort things coming right 8 values ive merged 4 sorted arrays second level merge sorted arrays level ive got sorted array number levels login size array step os combine ghetto login okay think stop pick wednesday sorry technical difficulties today stay warm looks like blizzard going snowball fight joy beautiful snow guys
right guys hear im yeah know hold wait slides working right yeah like half cs1 25 cloud slides think work itll minute load looks blank click x close load im thing guys tried tweak minute ago line like 12 machines set configured essentially private cloud use run lot infrastructure course thats slides playground auto gradient right point night half machines look like went offline management interface usually use kind reboot offline people know pre fire later happily dont use playground today gonna talking internet talking web right fun day time started talk internet looked couple different dimensions way therell attendance today probably counted im gonna promises ill look data looks like right based conversation time observed fact internet internet reliant huge infrastructure probably like trillions dollars things eventually eventually internet lot built older infrastructure know fiber optic cables follow old train lines fact years lot signals way house traveled lines built previous communication systems like phone lines stuff like infrastructure provides wired connections guys gotten increasingly having wireless store hop right wander campus lot times people actually computer plugged actual ethernet jack people okay half yeah thats increasingly rare right main machine gets actually plugged power right know internet revolution largely possible highquality glass weve create fiber optic cables unheralded modern world glass cable built carry signals connect right saw little bit wireless infrastructure space shortrange wireless access points idea example kind beautiful fascinating completely organic system right manages wifi access points country theyre throwing place new york city chicago urban center phone know denser denser parts town lot times like hundreds wifi access points right imagine know apartment building single apartments got medium range wireless infrastructure built allow connected youre outside range wifi building infrastructure investment devoted thing moving information allowing people communicate time space way possible know computers technological revolution guys living internet huge enabler right bunch computers werent connected mean fun play games use solve problems stuff like connectivity weve achieved enabled cool things gonna later today talk web apis web interfaces right point billions billions devices connected shared medium send information send signals think signals right send type signal time talked little bit protocol internet establishes exchanging information computers connected ip protocol specifies things right address right want send establish connection particular computer need know address data send data know signal trying wants send information know contact okay ip addressing weve seen generations time original ip address space big theory address billion machines reality actually allowed address far fewer new ipv6 address space thats increasingly allows address unfathomable number computers need sure addresses readable theyre bigger contain information ip specifies format data structure messages structure contains addresses talked contains data thats trying content news feed content text messages content request send amazon purchase content little messages computer sends server let know youre following class data ok right fascinating stories early evolution internet big im gonna_talk hopefully long interesting big struggle models connectivity seeing photo like old telephone exchange people dialed operator reason anybody people anymore dont know like fun like poke pull prank telephone lines established phone started operator literally oh man struggling today picked phone happen end talking nice person phone connected switch board like operator need know want place oh want friend joe lot times town operator knew friend neighbor knew people lived etc etc okay ill connect joe literally person theyre actually like plugging wires like spot essentially joes phone connected pegs switchboard way establish connection phones literally like plug know operator plug jack theres literal physical connection theres wire thats connecting friend theres phone starts ring pick connection established youre talking operator think know people asked internet works model like facebook theres like wire leads directly facebook thats communication right anybody soon set circuits people talking friend alright literally headsets wire connecting operators kind switch needs happen actually place actually online internet thats called packet switching know invented theorized caused huge debate telecommute telecommunication community people thought future turned right phone companies incredibly determined preserve old model phone circuits right thats understood phone companies sort like time major know technology company completely paradigm shifting innovation know netflix right netflix started sending cds mail got good theyre actually making shows streaming actually managed perform impressive pivot space streaming lot people said netflix right know network flicks got good sending dvds mail theyre going know turned wrong thats pretty impressive thing able telecom companies good building circuit switch networks point people came said hey different idea need data break inherently involves digital information old phone networks transmitting digital signals transmitting analog signals okay like speaker wire theres gonna sine wave running goes house friends house online digitized turned numbers remember talked beginning semester talked fact order computers process information turn numbers okay phone contents speech able convert converted series numbers right thats sound sound convert series numbers measure strength pressure wave particular point time use numbers reconstruct sound end step digitize things actually break nicely little pieces pieces called packets okay packet internet contains certain information normally order transmit thats reasonable size like want download photo want website look content webpage want stream audio video happens data reaches series chunks called packets packet contains small movie little bit photo characters tweet right actually tweets probably fit packet theyre pretty small right emails probably multiple packets email email broken little pieces pieces goes separate journey internet start point end point way follow different paths youre youre talking server california data way data way saw based map time theres bunch different paths data california facebook check newsfeed instagram look photos photo come know know come know direction come direction okay things thats cool internet protocol theres protocol sign guarantee reliable delivery important powerful things internet protocol doesnt try things says look way figure identify hosts connect internet thats address im gonna provide whats called best effort packet transmission computers internet backbone going routers let following thing called law packet receive connections theyre connected incoming connections receive packet connections look splitsecond decision connections theyre going route like know youre standing theres gives piece information right left day long fast highest speeds possible router trying packet stop closer basically theres router middle country youre line computer california sees packet coming looks destination says know packet hop closer know send computer im connected im located colorado maybe computer located california okay destination hasnt arrived facebook server thats computer california closer wants day long happens router gets overloaded lets suddenly lot people want send data forth particular place router cant data thats coming drops packets yeah routers allowed drop packets internet protocol doesnt guarantee packet making send request california halfway california request end router thats like know ive got way work dont space left store new requests im gonna drop poof gone obviously order internet work properly thats gonna know things im going talk interesting ip protocol guarantee reliable delivery best try data came trying step time pack idea breaking data little chunks moving way completely revolutionary proposed phone company executives hated idea antithetical believed understood circuits networks theres actually story earliest people proponents packet switch networks interacting phone company phone company set like multi day symposium brought bunch engineers bunch know people basically designed convince people packets bad idea thats goal talk terrible idea yeah people went like suppose right right turns today time talk phone particularly mobile phone thing happens phone voice gets digitized broken little packets old voice connections foundation know telecommunications networks preceded internet replaced packets packet switch networks right weve decided right way voice traffic moves alright know cool things ip doesnt gave birth beautiful ecosystem protocols allowed run want develop internet protocol today write protocol rules particular type thing run internet protocol weve come new protocols going talk little bit today exists serve specific applications reasons talking want dissuade idea thats normal hold internet web world wide web application runs internet protocol protocol formats going talk little bit minute know certain use guys use time thing internet right theres called hypertext transfer protocol service application support anybody know suspect know answer http frequently https yeah browser bar yeah protocol supports world wide web going talk little bit http minute http separate protocol rules runs ip ip provides transport layer higherlevel protocols okay http know smtp supports guys dont know starting irritation youre newer communication medium pretty important read smtp supports time time guys important blank anybody know ya email ya smtp supports email thats actually smtp interesting smtp protocol mail servers use talk send message friend goes school place message goes server campus server campus point send message server school called simple mail transfer protocol smtp dns ones pe protocol guys use time time web site time send email message time online anybody know yeah yeah dns responsible know looked ip addresses know people typed ip address browser like probably probably shouldnt way usually bad idea dont dont type 172 8 11 browser bar type com com right dns responsible translating human readable names guys use good humans like cs 125 dot cfo illinois dot edu actual ip addresses ip protocol time guys load web page thing happens web browser figure ok typed web address ip address correspond invent new internet protocols big deal recently people think theres activity building new protocols sort operate existing ones cases recently big companies example google google little bit afraid google operates highly website fact operates bunch highly websites com google docs gmail provides browser lot times google piece software web browser talk google piece software googles websites googles actually started experiment new transport protocol thats built ip designed replace transport protocols said know older protocols dont work youre google control sides lot network connections away right want want talk web want sure understand internet represents framework backbone bunch different protocols built ok know theres bunches protocols havent talked look track think thats going internet given point time lot web traffic probably theres lot types information protocols internet lot email theres specific protocols designed chat types information exchange right lets talk web right vague idea internet physical infrastructure protocol building block protocols want exchange information computers world wide web specific protocol http talked http protocol establishes way computers exchange information gives way request data server way send data certain theres parts ht web familiar actually parts called markup language html briefly minute html provides content moved world wide web html provides way browser semantic description website look like browser renders okay web styling language called css thats control websites look theres programming language thats heavily associated web called javascript thing way right help took 10 years figure relationship javascript java okay im thought long time real like oh scripting version java means right javascript completely different language unfortunately similar completely different languages fun coevolved fun story like java javascript form relationship fact theyre computer programming languages right lets look turn talked ip protocol said protocols establish structured communication parties compete computer system protocol set rules need followed thats computer system know diplomatic exchange example http protocol defines bunch different verbs different types ways client interact server talk http normally assuming theres clients thats device operate okay phone web browser theres server server room campus dont know machine especially virtual machine thats important job jobs serve cs 125 dot cs illinois ddu theres machine web server set doesnt client home page client sends request server says hey want content page okay time load page request type thats called request hey sounds like sends hey want stuff want information okay whats today campus infrastructure request thats somewhat interesting talk http like dozens right look sent useful use time called post requests ask server send information post request browser send information web server think browsing online pretty oneway relationship servers sending lots lots information youre contributing times post facebook buy amazon know click forth slide decks actions represents case browser information needs send server need tell facebook hey ive got new post feet need tell amazon yes want item cart yes want buy cart right time submit form kind pretty anytime press submit enter changes world observe browser set post request thats way browser send data server ok post slightly different semantics im gonna detail idea git supposed change world send data request thats allowed change world post able page changes post hand changes facebook feed new item credit card gets charged theres stuff thats shipped vendor online right ok people weve weve usually weve sort away people gotten warnings like dont submit form bad happen right submit form like twice number items cart expect right lets talk building blocks web minute right http defines ask server information theres question browse load website receive server little bit chunk html going detail like content class html describes page structured okay structure looks different okay theyre separated web heres heres example html content right tag know h1 html anymore ya toplevel header html defines bunch different header types idea sort like h1 important h2 important h3 important h important age right theres 600 types okay like important content page thats know website doesnt tell big bold says important semantic information called p open tag close tag open tag p close tag like forward slash followed open tag whats paragraph semantic information paragraph text dont know paragraph book right white space white space single unit textual information right sentence word character little bit higher level paragraph okay know l went little bit html hacking yeah list ordered list html types lists theres ordered unordered list inside list list items starts tag called li items list im gonna list items inside lot times ordered lists rendered numbers right unordered lists rendered bullet points thing indicate life okay ive got heres heres tag called strong mean strong means text inside strong right sort deserves emphasis thing want note semantics instructions look strong bold doesnt h1 bigger doesnt paragraph little bit white space right ordered list start numbers thats semantics right thats layout loaded web browser heres look okay notice web browser text h1 big added numbers list bold added white space paragraph browser default comes whats called builtin stylesheet thatll dont information browser says know think h1 big bold right thats im gonna think ordered list numbers attached itll kind default want happened css come minute right lets talk css talk evolution css defines website looks okay im going skim css file css set rules sent page allows tell browser want page look ive set rules example h1 going 48 pixels font size okay want bold want font thats body document thats pretty thing sans serif font thats font doesnt little know sharp things corners okay heres page looks send paige piece css happens thats awesome title large content thats serifs ive given browser information things work okay right heres fun right talk talk evolution web web web started essentially way distribute mint documents hey sent website looked like thats nice document think early web kind like nicer version pdf know pdf pdfs try fancy unnecessary things right dont theyre like document look right webpage point started happen web instead framework distributing documents web tool use distribute hope time web site website use youre like dinosaurus old web site like refused add html css piece code written language called javascript hey javascript code runs browser browser knows interpret javascript thats actually way want open special tab browser actually type code run okay happens know shouldnt happens entirely powers interactive websites google docs know music players guys use photo apps guys use pretty online try disabling javascript browsers turn discover internet works anymore okay reason website visit actually small computer program huge computer program like google docs incredibly complicated right fullblown editor like trying microsoft word written javascript runs browser okay heres know teach course javascript certainly gonna minutes left heres little piece javascript okay im gonna plain semantics theyre probably pieces look little bit familiar program java gonna look unfamiliar javascript different language heres piece javascript bring time days terrible web design days end page like hey anybody remember blinking text yeah youre young right feel like like primary ways websites attention like website like different parts blinking know blinking blinking blinking synchronized itll little right ill like know like attention simple webpage blinking alright thats piece code thats added previous example okay im going providing javascript page computer program thats cool right mean guys browse online web pages web applications send email online web application write paper online web application think fairly quickly expect years years programming going online guys prairie learn think like android studio maybe little bit fully feature runs browser setup know store locally website kind like google docs microsoft online version current ids program going away going implemented online thatll lot convenient okay know javascript reflects know evolution web point happened sites visit sent document okay entered era browse site think little bit okay use information great example site like store right particularly sophisticated ecommerce platforms like com com dont page somebody room somebody different city different country amazon uses information knows produce home page designed goal mind think goal buy right know idea like theres page thats gonna work buy instead im gonna tailor page users amazon page produces sitting disk created fly created based amazon knows request coming youre logged amazon purchase recently information uses produce beautiful page goal okay era common page lot work server basically send big chunk javascript okay server essentially provides data javascript runs browser work example grade page works way grade page working probably right happens framework sends huge javascript starts run requests data server grades class uses render page shows know graphs scores okay lets okay ive minutes know place trying time web api alright internet web know people start realize hey great way moving data things web server important request information send data right inside framework okay thing unpack api okay api application programmer interface remember talked interfaces talked java said general concept applied know farther java concept interface interface describes set things entity okay application programmer interface specifically designed use application programmer sentence interface provided somebody theyre theyre saying hey want build app integrates service like lets want process photos online lets want build uses data github lets want use weather data lets want use data bus service publicly available ill provide way information maybe ill provide way things web called api application programmer interface application program heres lets lets simple example heres example weather api ok imagine designing probably lot functions right heres example weather api java ok weather info class functions returning way weather particular location way weather particular location particular time overloads way figure location require weather location object right produce lets user gives string says champaign illinois want use produce weather location okay functions working actual interface create java idea create allows query weather okay im assuming data weather im trying provide right unlike national weather service system got okay probably find like java library allow program java like normally youd figure like use library know fields weather info object know blah blah blah right consider following send information server okay actually couple ways theres called url parameters request talk minute wednesday server run code return response heres thing thats key okay data website sends html okay set website sends send text send binary data corresponds photo send want web api typically website web page html document information sends program person youre gonna look websites design rendered process visual data need structure different way gonna gonna utilize fact build web api gonna leverage fact web web protocol allows stuff web protocol dictate content returned request html send want historical reason reasons people started hard build custom protocols computer security people campus decided unsafe run protocols block variety http typically use reasons people started building essentially protocols new interfaces http building new internet program right time left think probably good spot stop pick wednesday couple announcements today theyre important blue team finished machine project night congratulations orange team date tonight hopefully gradient server propped right thing guys ahead machine project esque final project final project description anybody view tomorrow guys review lab tomorrows lab time start working start finding partner ok youre finding team work ok weeks quiz want important guys gonna want hear weeks quiz multiple choice questions sorting programming questions sorting ok reason code sorting algorithm multiple choice questions im dumb ask implement sorting algorithm multiple programming questions alright break hopefully youve forgotten learned sorting right ill guys wednesday good luck finishing machine
music balcony hear okay great welcome cs 125 todays exciting day actually hope guys great long weekend keeping homework beautiful day outside im excited today going talk new way working data computer programs theres points semester going expand kind data work today important moments point weve seen things computers know things computers good thats interesting thats mainly limitations type data actually work access far weve talking math making decisions based single data values today gonna_talk ways store multiple data values initial exploration richer use data comes important limitations way interesting weve talked far turns lot new way working data talk changes looking lecture night semester like huh think classic past talked topic think classic computer scientist mistake lot love stuff interested talk people particularly people new classic mistake kind talk things talk youd want ive essentially inverted ordering topics today try sense certain language constructs java going talk later okay going talk things fast gonna start talking want repeat mainly new way storing data like said far weve talking primarily ways store single data values jonathas primitive types allow store single integer single number floatingpoint component single character single truth value limited theres computer work single values want hello thats interesting okay hacked chromecast dont okay setup like fall apart moment right hopefully thats precursor bad things come right talking single data values java primitive types allow work lets try know enrich vocabulary want work multiple values create multiple variables int create int variables names thats limiting gets messy quickly want want able work arbitrary number values let place stipulation restriction type java primitive types instead working time work bunch time new kinds information like said huge know explosion ability work data new kinds data represent work computer program somebody example sure think yeah batter string yeah text text text series characters primitive type available need represent interesting data source stuff text actually things computer science come sort late human speech actually messy hard computers work able text weve taken time data computer systems right work know organizations oh wow like dont work barriers organizations digitizing textual information books library turn texts turn sequence characters computers work computers actually fascinating things information getting started seeing kind impact thats gonna things like google books project dont know bothering lets theres making noise lets right okay gonna drive guys nuts dont know making highpitched whine okay text text know start able allow computers work text theres sorts cool things strings yeah okay yeah table know know twodimensional level flatten sequence data start associate multiple values like spreadsheet think single series data right tax thing sorts stuff yeah dna right human genome yeah good reading slides thank wow right youre following thats good youre gonna participation points today yeah dna right cells data weve turned data weve turned data digitizing information right stored computer computers use information cool stuff right okay time series data like happens time measure like temperature right like humidity air pressure stuff know world right whats particularly interesting time series data potentially guys probably enjoy time slides music music form time series data bunch measurements air pressure thats sound voice reaching speakers air causing air vibrate right microphone turning vibrations series measurements transmitted process thing interfering system causing highpitched scream okay raise basic talking week theyre super powerful dramatically expand kind data work thing want recognize arrays class learning lowlevel details computer actually work accurate representation computer actually stores information internally giant huge array integers computer 32 gigabytes ram means running remember 32 billion numbers way organized long series obviously guys multiple future courses actually works practice okay right array java represents series zero values type limitation talk later semester course things lot interesting start talking data represent start mixing different types information little bit characters integers represent information person right age weight stuff like talking series type create array java particularly useful limitation job arrays type right arrays actually awesome want clear important important understand somebodys concepts talk easy instances mental model start talking complicated things course guys semesters data structures arrays data structure data structures implies add structure data dish data raw data structure way theres additional information added arrays example array data imagine like deck cards sitting thats jumbled cards order ive created array consists cards data cards array order theres additional piece data metadata data data ive added system cards card place ordering okay thats position arrays values order order order data important example took human genome human genome symbols okay took jumbled doesnt work anymore right wouldnt create proteins required create life mess right theres theres information thing example took music music fundamental level digital music series numbers specific order numbers jumble throw place noise sounds actually probably lot like white noise right music anymore ive lost structure away structure arrays bring data lot times locked structure important array right values array additional piece information refer index thats position array data structure adds structure data structure data structure information values array values position array ive added information alright lets look syntax actually java line example im showing declare single integer review time line im declaring array integers youll ive added bracket syntax brackets type java im telling computer variable called multiple going store int gonna store multiple integers gonna store array integers im taking number integers dont know gonna come minute variable gonna store going store zero integers type bracket syntax indicate array java primitive types ive created array characters line seven review im declaring variable called serves single character line im declaring variable called stores array characters okay bracket syntax tell computer variable storing single value going store dot usually declare array tell java elements im gonna limitations data structure java youve learned python learn javascript languages like rust familiar limitation limitation actually goes long time earliest computer languages create array java tell computer large start cant change size array know create new array thats bigger copy data stuff like original array going size array size set initialize clear array line im creating array integer whats array multiple right initialization initialize single value typically literal variable new syntax literally new syntax keyword new type thats left inside brackets literal tells java elements want array store array thats gonna store integers okay says java create array new array store integers im gonna refer array variable multiple arrays java nice feature know long know elements array new piece syntax syntax gonna sense later unfortunate things java kind push right youre gonna wrap head later talk objects youll dot notation comes want access length array thinking variable declared stores refer array dot length special keyword length length gets value array split parts im declaring going store array characters initialize hold characters alright questions seeing new syntax new java new program lots practice okay awesome initialize array initial values want initialize right fill data want contain started heres example left im telling java im declaring integer array called multiple right curly braces inside series literal value separated commas crates large array dont tell java count computer count says okay im looking inside values im gonna relies size thing right create character array initialized right dont specify size java figure based initialize array array gonna size looks inside curly braces sees values okay ive showed declare arrays set size initialize digital values usually array want use store data want way data thats right frequently important able data array specific spot remember position data array meaningful example people look patterns human genome human genome array values order looking different types patterns data want able figure values particular location data structure array java called bracket notation square brackets want access wont playground minute know lot know new syntax example sec line line ive created integer array called twos ive initialized values size piece syntax retrieves value index zero array new computer science little bit weird okay index 0 element array going print slides gonna print 1 thats element refer week 1 cs 125 week 0 week right computer scientists start people find annoying start numbering things 0 okay 0 actually number right value array index 0 set values job array similar syntax line 3 im modifying value array im changing originally 1 thank greg 2 ive set 2 ive assigned 2 says assign value array choose position 0 value 2 like variable assignment assign values array literal assign variable kind sign moment okay lets whats whats_interesting important arraigns things chance work multiple values ok second thing arrays associate new piece data metadata structure data inside array create array ive added data system know values inside value position positions meaningful right data contents actual values stored inside array metadata position order ive added thats structure data structure simple data structure right alright questions arrays promise playground actually think thats gonna come later yeah yeah question different types data array answer java array value right type probably starting like limitations theres certain types data cant work requires mixing different types information big expansion kind data work class objects start talking represent complex pieces data thing point programming languages allow python list integers strings couple floatingpoint values dont java like limitation turns makes code lot easier reason safely python list elements idea whats java know know theyre integers great question question right yeah ah okay question initial values stored create array come ask question minute ill yeah question create lets lets create array whats inside right happen printed value index zero talk sec great question easiest playground yeah yes question want append value array like want array bigger yes essentially create new array copy data add value right talk later later class start implement interesting data structures implement flexible version array thats called list allows add remove elements copy order question okay way storing multiple data values right dont useful idioms working data values right example store know text constitution live records library congress wanted like count number times letter w appears example text huge array characters dont want like cant ive seen value value location 38 value location 297 thats want want want write code actually goes array value value time figures brings second half todays class talk things computers extremely good things quickly okay lot times repeated operations performing computer running working type array like data structure data thats stored array common play music right like im know right computer sending screen device frequently taking data screen sending data okay extremely quickly change slide construct use new piece language syntax use java way describe process loop right makes sense youre loop youre going circle thing loops basic building blocks working data arrays data whats exciting right data science hot new term find amusing computer scientists worked data thats thing program right idea theres new thing called data size little funny im happy people excited right new computer scientists worked data rest life want process lot data need able things need use construct called loop requires introducing couple new pieces java syntax simplest possible loop start called loop heres simplest possible loop java im showing ive got new pieces syntax lets slow lets examine time talked statements examples new syntax special way instructing computer okay special words special meaning java cant variable okay whats known reserved word reserved means heres syntax loop word parenthesis condition conditional expression needs evaluate boolean im boolean literal thats common usually type tests im number smaller number like im determine continue run piece code block saw talked tape code inside block im going repeat like want write big program inside loop want goes inside block want indented right readable tell whats inside block open curly brace close curly brace code inside block long condition true java continue execute code itll start line itll run code inside block return time gets loop reevaluate condition loop stop executing java going going ok condition true yeah run code inside block ok im condition true stuck youre semester right yeah im going repeat thats thats literally repeat code stops sort problem right loop parts theres block code repeat thats inside braces theres condition true time start loop condition true loop doesnt run okay soon condition evaluates false java stop executing code rerun block instead continue loop itll jump block code declared loop running okay lets experiment okay lets think expect happen piece code ive got index thats int variable loop checking index happens code gets run whats line code gets run yeah yeah index entered block starts line run code inside okay print index line good review variable updates common yeah increase index equivalent index equal index plus index plus equals shortcut incrementing index condition test condition time went loop index zero initialized second time loop whats value index 4 execute code anger increment index whats index kind going lets run code long weve little bit fun okay lets think happened time came loop index zero added went x continued added lets think happens print index equal line index add whats value index loop stops executing java goes says ns lesson jumps prints okay fantastic power fingertips computers things efficiency clive thompson talks encoders ability repeat stuff ability know drudge work computer know boring human right imagine thing inside loop like worst boring thing right like mow lawn maybe like mowing lawn right wash dish like right tell computer right doesnt care tired computers incredibly gnarly things complained ok dont complain dont tired dont time time theyre incredibly good type boring drudge work right typically want stop point unterminated loop stop point causes stop variety different things right run tests happen point like wait code run way long asked print hello world times shouldnt seconds right gone awry terminate code normally problem right soon occur know dont malicious right theres anecdote actually remember theres anecdote chapter book talking basic programming program basic ok thats good actually basic language lot issues kind fun simple know remember know old computers school like writing little piece code print like bad word right screen teacher couldnt turn best thing know teachers figured okay theres special keys hit itll stop came like nastier versions right actually literally turn computer right stopped right didnt like spent lot time middle school sweeping parking lot point point wasnt reasons heres example non malicious way mistake okay whats gonna happen run piece code right looks lot like example start index zero enter loop im checking print oh heres problem right subtract okay lets happens okay negative negative yes continue going right thing stopped loop index getting bigger eventually going reach 4 condition going true anymore index getting smaller lets happens run code okay run code helpful playground actually print like lot values right tell program timed mean means killed program code killed program thats actually happened code case killed throat program bad wasnt stopping points like 200000 lines arent shown right actually lot progress got turning okay example unterminated loop point youre writing code thats malicious right like youre trying mess right know run know eventually itll print lot stuff time okay things language designers identify pattern people code theyll try easier okay lot times write loop performing certain number times going value array particular operation certain number times know type pattern common loop entire world write lot code look like created index set index zero repeat loop index value time add result pattern inside loop gets executed times according condition set inside loop use literal times code executed change think actually 10 times yeah im basically certain number times im controlling number times changing value okay forcing write special piece loop syntax new kind loop im gonna thats designed help handle called loop weve looked loop loop simpler loop loop starts little bit interesting loop equivalent loop okay lets careful stepbystep reserved word java cant variable called special meeting job means youre creating loop loops work differently loops youll level look similar ive got ive got parentheses loop thing inside parentheses condition checked time entered forloop ive got things loops parts okay left right initialization step happens time loop entered second condition checked time enter loop including time final update referred update statement runs time loop repeats run time way java executes says ok im gonna create variable called declare variables inside thats actually useful im gonna declare variable called index type int initialize zero im going run im going check im gonna execute body loop im going run update statement index im going check condition true ill run loop okay parts confusing think right ways help understand loops work rewriting loops vice versa loop rewrite loop okay lets lets loop im gonna run behavior expect lets rewrite loop thing need need change okay im gonna bit initialization line thats thing loop thats initialization stuff condition thing need update statement loop loop body pour loop declaration loop okay lets run sure thing okay good loop like rewrite loop wanted use loop need declare variable loop cant loop remove conditional need stick update statement inside loop theres going drug right ill leave guys practice later loops complicated loops loops simples condition true execute body loop stop loop things know time youre class reasons daily homework reasons weekly quizzes practice stuff end day end life computer program decades problems youve solved cool ways guys gonna change world right im relying right im getting old im getting gonna older couple weeks right guys know know point im point im gonna like stop learning new languages stuff like im know im gonna stuff ones use anymore right guys actually world better place point later think loops ive written life dont know dont know hundreds thousands right start right dont think flow fingertips like learning write okay heres mind youre getting started initialization step body happens time loop executed conditional actually evaluated time conditional true enter loop false dont isnt true time loop condition starts false loop executed loop body skipped going update performed block executes time dont update block execute performed checked condition update statement check condition condition true going stop alright basically algorithm java executing talk algorithms friday series steps java executes runs loop check condition condition false continue execution condition true rerun block block finishes update run update statement repeat true okay im going detail ill let guys good thing youre gonna loops like okay loops gonna start variable 0 gonna value youre gonna increment suspect 98 loops ive written life kind okay common lets think learning stuff right whats initializing whats variable mention elijan loop whats loop actually called loop right says initialize declare variable called loop initialize checking im checking equal updating actually adding okay lets happens run times going execute starts equal yes acute loop time come loop check condition right 6 equal 8 yes thats second time time whats value loop 8 8 equal 8 loop update add loop 10 10 equal 8 oh stop okay leave guys review know unfortunately type statements great fodder quiz questions couple things like weeks quiz ask need help forum little bit esoterica couple important things parts loop required 3 parts parts separated semicolons inside parentheses initialization semicolon check semicolon update dont rare okay know mean im putting case future sense fact okay probably code looks like common right leave variable declaration im declaring variables loop im exists im updating variable loop im checking condition essentially equivalent loop im checking condition updating variable essentially equivalent true loop stop okay good thing practice confused rewrite loop loop thatll help loops simpler freezer okay things want talk important statements important things inside loop affect loop execution talk friday start develop simple algorithms programming tools tool bag okay break special keywords java theyre special computer okay break means immediately execute enclosing loop use break statement maybe going big array data found value looking want stop dont need look rest date okay break terminate loop hit break jump loop going dont finish update variable stop jump loop immediately execute code thats continue little bit interesting continue jumps loop immediately normally happen happen loop check condition loop update variable check condition continue essentially says going maybe piece data array im looking interesting maybe dont want im gonna going okay whats going happen let little bit extra logging right guys thinks gonna happen ive got ive got new stuff going exciting im sorry combine things ive got loop conditional inside okay talk friday start talk algorithm build tools ive got loop im going series integers inside statement statement true im gonna print break keyword break keyword stops loop immediately okay lets run happens okay found found found end find value im looking okay im gonna stop today talk continue time announcements guys pack homework continues today homework continues day homework problems day assigned way things work december okay office hours today starting noon didnt finish setting android studio probably lab plan coming office hours week care havent machine project friday dont office hours today guys
okay people hear row way right thank good okay today gonna_talk new type data work java going ease topic going later consume good second semester talking java objects java objects represent dramatically new programming style learn real enriching ability work data thats objects gonna example java object day special java object couple kinks theres couple things working text text important humans little bit different java thats gonna today thing want big thank ben monday filling oh okay lets long lasts okay questions material covered monday listened class feel like ben fantastic job questions started today functions topic homer problems week leading guys having chance work weeks quiz things want point homework problems know challenges java introductory language attach training wheels early process week guys wrote snippets code know declared variables supposed use having write complete functions okay thats step having write entire functions eventually youre actually going working entire object java thinks code weve taken set training wheels usually little confusing people started couple weeks working entire youll designing entire java objects wont worry anymore taken training wheels going forward expect class homework problems definitely asking write function function specific thing thats going contain snippet code similar writing okay lets talk dramatic expansion kind data weve able work far weve talked processing story manipulating data java tubs jabez primitive data types right integers floating point numbers characters weve talked arrays talked week use know integer floatingpoint number thats interesting theres world accurately describe single number expanded able work entire sequences lists arrays types data weve working mainly numbers text important component world right big missing pieces important type data work java makes exceptions work java programming language unique job languages treat tax specially important right text cant represent great works fiction famous book author grew actually cant represent human communication thats going world right know fair think data human generate day fair text communications people right written communication know think interesting things looking sort decades technology sort explosion text messaging textual basis different ways communicate text period time lot conscious theres period time lot people thought know voice gonna know pretty soon know video chatting know calling time stuff like actually suspect lifetimes young text communication people actually skyrocketed right mean easy phone 20 years ago gotten way easier send small pieces text thats know texting application chat application slack right actually kind interesting know surprise right technology brought sorry people actually like communicate text right think theres deep reasons theres lots places world text standin type identifier right license plate numbers great example heres example know need kind id need unique way identify plate supposed identify vehicle okay doesnt text like picture barcode like humans work text remember right know saw know accident like car sped barcode difficult tell police person saw text youre likely remember right thats stuck passwords right passphrases guys today thing humans good remembering text good remembering sequences numbers okay lot interesting data world form textual form computer scientist string thats term use cant remember mean point computer scientist totally changed brain think probably referred dax way words strings right thats word piece computer data consists series characters okay know cant remember knowing right mean ive referring things strings java way work strings theres couple things slide disturbing okay theres new new things right theres type java working series characters actually theres type java working series characters type weve talked thats thing disturbing know work series characters want store series characters program guys know like dont need new type right right yeah yeah dont seize array characters right right dont know thing worry right theres special type java series integers okay thats curious right like theres redundancy right way work text right told store entire know know record congressional sunning big long array characters want okay java actually special type worrying whats different type ones weve seen thats evident slide yeah oh like theres answers okay uses double quotes yeah okay actually good forgot right literal values im assignment variable worked text working single characters java want single character little use single quotes use double quotes string thats thats interesting means java sort builtin support type data somebody answer liked person vaguely direction repeat answer different type slide theres new way declare literals yeah yeah yeah data types weve seen right let slides list byte short int long float double care car okay lets vote people like car want opinion car care sorry guys think care habit people approach work partisans think care win day alright boolean right types denoted single case letters ive got thing called string capital turns important okay level squint looks like types data able work far okay line im declaring new variable called maybe type strength like declared variable store int boolean lines sign reassigning value maytee line sign challenge string literal right literal value variable specific string appears code ive enclosed double quotes assigning maybe lying execute maybe value challen dont like gonna change jeff line thats reassignment identical weve seen line im calling function right dont know function thats looks like function function called variable called maybe variables inside function takes single argument okay strings look familiar strings start behave differently strings new features right let right ive got know ive got stream variable line lets comment okay looks similar similar saw remind ive worked java length way length yeah array right little different okay difference gonna guarantee difference gonna gonna catch lets try array equal o lets declare int array length 9 care array sorry lets print length okay sorry kerry whats different places java gonna mess asks semester case answer idea right programmer decision find person complain stuck whats different yeah way yeah wanted length array magic dot special property called length right right works want length string similar tack pair parentheses length look like string review monday looks little bit like im yeah sort looks like im calling function yeah like stuff know pass argument doesnt argument im gonna compiler error starting looks like function okay turns arrays access link thats special feature strength turns theres bunch things strings string variable theres number different things variable knows comes special features example guys dont know thats totally fine lets use powers intuition try figure whats going line print length string okay looks lot like array wants hypothesis whats happening line lets walk think yeah yeah im im testing way examining im basically asking java tell variable stored string stored variable password equal case string literal right looks like function cuz im passing argument im use im starting variable mean dot im following looks like function im passing data cause true right false right thats consistent suspicion way comparing strings theyre examine hypothesis yeah ziz yes yeah pronounced ziz perfect exactly true okay piece data right looks like think lets tiny little change zs cat false okay apparently examines case letter upper lower case okay reasons tell mean theres bunch reasons talked strings theyre fascinated text aid super interesting theyre example java object strings kind interesting java object sort sneak java general language argue highly consistent fault places java easier use consistent strives high level consistency forces things pretty dumb like place far tell sure places java display little bit flexibility imagine people design language having arguments right strings objects allow assigned literals ill explain means know place blending world primitive types objects okay going talk lot objects general object programming technique allows combine state behavior brings things weve talked class weve working variables weve taking variable weve sign value point variable state knows value assigned time talked functions functions way single piece logic perform computation cases algorithm solving problem wrap nice tidy package use reuse code objects bring things look example variable password right password clearly knows things order complete function method password know things thing nice know whats value series characters stored stored contents right straight password remember assign variable literal cat know sequence characters know know compare strength theres algorithm algorithm won maybe maybe ill write new homework problem post tree guys hard theres algorithm determining strings equal password knows bringing declare string variable use save information cool features come ill bunch minute okay reiterate talk couple weeks string state thats sequence characters stored stored variable array characters behavior functions operate state use state equals function uses data ive stored inside variable string pass compare decide strings alright think objects going come questions data store things allows algorithms use help things knows accomplish okay let know kind reiterate little bit help understand distinction right primitives java store value right primitive types value create array sequence values series values type java primitive types names start lowercase letter theres actually memorize want think impress somebody maybe recruiter objects hand mixtures primitive types objects start talking objects going fully today soon allow essentially represent type data represent mixture primitive types pretty open objects represent kind data want work represent numerical form digitize order computer able work create object java represents objects names start capital letter convention java important allows identify type starts uppercase letter know youre dealing java object suppose primitive type gonna lots lots lots practice spend like month going gonna use strings entry point world objects okay told strings weird theres weird accommodations java strings ok strings special right bit special treatment language heres normally create java object use new keyword guys familiar seen new keyword yeah yeah wed initialize array right saw new keyword set array arrays java turns objects dont interesting properties length property theyre internally objects normally talk initializing strings initialize java objects going going talk whats happening later strings essentially way works way java example heres variable declaration im saying hey java want create string variable called string right im initializing variable im saying create new string inside parentheses looks like function function talk little bit later pass string literal im saying want contents string variable letters abc second_line im creating string string variable contents df create java strings way strings special treatment language work java allows create shorthand create string literal enclosing sequence characters double quotes theres type data java weird case im going talk gets type treatment right equivalent java objects create word new turns happy help guys investigate forum want tiny difference ways creating strings tiny meaningful difference guys want ask forum ill happy talk actually kind interesting youre interested sort java works gonna bother gonna consider equivalent normally gonna know going initialize strings know java way use java object type java supports literal assign java object reason works actually use string sequence characters inside double quotes literal assignment types object java allow comes class string literal object value appears code like said distinction gonna trip careful single quotes java character character inside single quotes double quotes string zero characters inside string 1 10 100 try initialize time compiler catch times confused right careful time java want use double quotes single quotes rare youre gonna need okay point know weve seen new syntax arrays reason needed new arrays java objects didnt want talk didnt bring starting dip toe world objects need talk okay bit special treatment strings language theres special operator combining okay want combine strings java use plus operator string variables want concatenate theres meaningful combination combined meaning combine right im im appending going contain contents plus space thats string literal variables plus contents laughs going contain place java language bends backwards accommodate particular kind object right lets lets stuff spring strings right promised concatenate things lets output okay clear methods work right change new string d ef going work change assignment literal change assignment literal great right work fine style typically use expect use homework problems class know want guys use variable twice concatenation right plus operator works doesnt sense right times know plus operator meaningful role im working strings okay told strings contained state know basically combined aspects variables functions know state know data capabilities features methods string comes use called dot notation syntax magical happens java lot languages actually adopted dot notation pretty common think python uses javascript uses uses know rust haskell uncommon way access feature property object right property method heres couple examples builtin features string okay talked line thats way length string thats useful lot times im working data strings like array lot times work string want character character think happening line guys dont expect know im expecting think write read okay think text data right wants hypothesis line yeah yeah hypothesis thats going string gonna replace t lowercase t lowercase b okay think thats reasonable test minute fourth line want speculate going yeah yeah gonna change string uppercase want point software engineering able im assuming knew different features methods string provides started looking variable able helped yeah chose good function names right person created string object java like person somebody sat implemented choice functions chosen foo chosen bar worked computer doesnt care able exercise choose good function names look code actually figure lot whats happening having understand right right find different goodies string class comes theres documentation right look google java string hits hopefully hit going jabbas official documentation string class look lot lot java doc later okay look apologize behalf java doc okay know born future look shudder little bit webpages look happily designed readability okay actually lot useful information need spend time particularly work homework problems prepare quizzes looking dont necessarily read probably know theres huge text theres section called method summary starting gonna theres description bunch different methods string object talked okay replace documentation says returns string resulting place occurrences old care string new care thought little bit farther upper case converts characters string uppercase rules default locale thats interesting explain theres little bit latent dont know like western world centrism yeah yeah theres like dont think capital letters chinese know lot suspect lot languages world dont necessarily notion case uppercase normally use default rules came version java parts world doesnt sense worth working certain types string data right lets test hypothesis thought replace going cheese replace bs confirm looking documentation whats printed start test b esp ive replaced ts bs okay great whats printed capital test thing want notice point interesting code yeah yeah change things t b print example uppercase test reason modify string java dont doesnt modify string inside doesnt modify contents example returns new string changes requested let try lets lets clear right itll string second equal example dot replace im going print example second oh okay good yeah ive created new variable called second murs contents result taking example replacing ts bs print example second example changed example initialized functions true pretty methods string class dont modify string return new string modifications requested okay lets yeah know im gonna leave bit playground lets example ill questions gonna little algorithm example minute questions strengths know understand particularly beginners class kind awkward moment right kind like stuck kind halfway straddling world objects world variables weve talking far unfortunately java thats kind strings strings awkward spot sort sort pretend theyre normal primitive types youre confronted fact objects couple important ways questions strings example pointing question oh yeah yeah ah okay question print example length prints arent indexing zero index array start zero dont lie length things right length string example minute character string position zero second position physician fourth position length return actual number characters integers thats stored inside array case string know hypothesis think string stores data inside guess yeah array characters maybe maybe thats connected fact string change contents right cant change length array change contents wanted certain cases general cant new string modified content okay lets example gonna solve little problem going use strings monday thats examples cant remember think think past version characters gonna use string heres want want write going write snippet going encapsulate function thing algorithm want implement want find cases string characters characters string consecutive characters right walk english high level algorithm solving problem lets think going solve particularly hard lets come approach figure code explain algorithm solving problem dont worry string cant figure minute yeah mmhmm yeah im gonna lets lets lets think im gonna character string okay need way right youre solving problems like know fact lets right okay im gonna im gonna examine character string im gonna compare value ill print theyre right lets notes need im going examine character string need lets figure work things little bit complicated programming construct weve talked need use yeah need kind loop yeah lets try loop im going start index im going increment 1 time need remember array string array want lets array characters right yeah yeah essentially want character string want character im gonna walk long im gonna continue long length string promise guys gonna mistake thats okay thing im gonna sure indices working properly okay tell whats wrong lets run happens actually thats okay saying somethings wrong line thats thats loop saying cant find length symbol okay wrong yeah yeah string length method property sense talk objects remember theres difference okay right good looks like im right thing mississippi 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 letters indices 0 10 okay im right track need able want compare character need able indices working properly yeah find character im gonna modify answer find character index okay die documentation okay start scrolling kind look equals okay thats nice okay actually wait think wouldnt buy oh yeah look care method takes variable type int variable type whats variable type int returns care value specified index sounds promising going im going taking string variable input dot notation dot need method want okay lets try okay error telling line 5 care applied saying required int care function actually tell character stranger want look case character okay im getting im getting warm know loop string know extract character particular position string right okay im close need need know character current position goal find places character character im particular position string lets im position neighbors plus whats neighbor minus example index neighbors actually use im going use plus lets lets im going print character position equal character position plus prettier minute going work lets try happens oh theres oh yeah forgot use dot notation oh mad theres okay ive got problem different kind error guys learned different kind errors week whats gone wrong tried index 11 character string 11 characters pairs characters 10 need modify slightly okay says characters false sucker characters false characters true looks right actually like prettier actually characters thinks identical think conditional working properly think comparison im working properly want print characters actually yeah oh okay yeah hes saying print character plus prison actually characters equal heres im gonna instead thats actually nice idea im going print character algorithm decided equal okay looks right s character thats repeated mississippi theres second s thats repeated theres p lets repeat lets try things lets sure gonna start thinking adversarially code gonna find cases think work special case repeated character right beginning okay work case miss character right end work writing id probably write tests example string shouldnt string repeated character okay right work time im gonna heres im gonna im gonna run long people start nervous guys packing going slide read announcements dont need yell guys leaving posted announce whats forum periodically
right everybody wednesday nearing end unit class today gonna wrap talking imperative programming chance fun talk little bit java actually works point weve teaching communicate machine java language havent talked whats actually going java code runs weve hinted little bit guys looked different stages program goes little bit lab important understand kind error messages receive today actually going talk little bit detail ill little bit exactly going scenes start help week start talk objects okay little bits syntax clean sort know theyre end section course theres sort oddities think theyre worth introducing good review given midterm week remember wild loop looked way computer repeat series steps loop form keyword followed conditional expression thats evaluated time loop starts condition true enter body loop delineated curly braces run code inside return evaluate condition okay loop constructs talking today theyre common want briefly different form loop valid loop write java called dowhile loop youll looks little bit different starts keyword theres body block delaney bad curly braces end theres condition think differently yeah yeah syntax designed help remember happens condition run loop condition help remember gets checked enter loop dowhile loop condition gets checked loop executes possible loop execute time reach condition false dowhile loop execute itll ill going going run loop second time im gonna run times know im im bringing things attention times youre gonna write code youd like oh im having write awkward loop oh right remember years ago theres thing called dowhile loop actually clean things bit places helpful know run run code loop loops condition ive initialized variable called im continuing loop zero starts zero condition starts false entered loop body statement enter loop body dowhile thats difference okay good statements sort expansions variations little extra spice added things weve seen remember statements showed use implement conditional logic computer programs decisions thing true piece code shade arbitrary number conditions statement youll like thing true check bunch things java variant javas point jabbas version particular programming construct good programming better youll powerfully languages like haskell places okay version called switch statement condition condition condition java im switching based variable write cases value variable possibly think java variable reasons statement isnt powerful java variable condition think primitive type cant remember dont use job helpful youll languages powerful okay switches limited terms check right cho case heres reminder check primitive types strings things ifelse statement execute arm statement potentially 0 ive got noel ill switch statement actually bump multiple ones depending set essentially sweat switch statement executed java looks case look playground second java looks case matches expression starts executing dont brace statement ill actually fall execute bunch pasty okay lets lets look works right whats going happen ive got switch statement im switching value variable called test going start whats value test statement starts executing letter im gonna print c theres break statement whats program gonna gonna print d gonna print set zero ill start way set like im gonna e break dont gross separate line stop certain point start zero b c break takes okay spend huge time friday gonna throated review problems look code guys submitted talked things preparation midterm week questions talk brief discussion java internals guess wont brief rest class yeah question switch statement executed start looked case matches variable im testing start k 0 value variable im switching 0 continue downward find break leave switch statement time happened started 0 printed kept going print kept going printed c break statement break left switch state lets lets little tricky understand youre gonna gonna print c start break statement ill start ill start print half expression good good question questions new idea imperative programming stuff seen far fair game launch fun aggressively yeah oh sorry yep thank reminder okay better okay yeah remind future id like low possible dont like hear voice im talking want people able hear im sorry check right okay lets talk little bit actually happening run java program kind environments weve prepared use class weve designed learning purposes weve actually hide lot details thats intentional dont want worry stuff couple weeks youre getting comfortable figuring communicate computer thats confusing lets look little bit gonna_talk details actually happening submit code playground submit prayer euler hit play button grade button intellij actually going scenes hope interest know computer scientist theres know ive liked field know fact simultaneously user things curious actually find lot theres lot documentation things work lot times way drawn example point decide learn machine_learning youre actually going chance little bit later semester start youre kind user tools youre like oh wow cool know library google use classification data set predictions based thats cool point youre gonna start wonder like hey whats actually happened actually work thats good thing encourage know indulge cure right dont understand use works mean maybe someday actually pretty awesome place know start things time dig little bit computer science open field find lot want learn okay particular explanation help clear things confusing point tines error messages getting certain things work way okay interesting theres thinking know right morning book write little bit story gonna_talk super super interesting involved okay im gonna try avoid going know mindnumbing detail people involved class im band course developers deeply knowledgeable java language questions ask answer great detail learn lot learning little bit know okay lets talk actually happened know hit submit learn hit return ctrl return playground actually happens okay roughly steps talked little bit lab think worth reiterating thing java takes source code wrote okay talked talked refer source code performs transformation refer compilation okay compiles theres piece software called java compiler gonna run minute normally dont run gets run use intellij scenes use priven piece software called java compiler performs step journey writing piece code actually seeing causes computer step train formation code executed transformed transformed format refer bytecode java bytecode okay people like language like c c like past okay teaches high school oh okay poor choices languages actually compile actual computer processor execute interesting things java going come minutes java widely adopted languages produce compiler produces actually need program run okay compiler called bytecode computer processor run bytecode instead errors stage theyre called compilation errors right cant compile code cant run okay im rooney flow thing happens code actually executed theres actually computer program thats called java virtual machine talk minute okay thing run program called java compiler gonna refer java c minute takes source code produces different representation called bytecode thing called java virtual machine run java takes bytecode actually executes wondering know okay dont know lot computers work know theyve got processor supposed actually able execute instructions twostep process thing called virtual machine involved thats actually interesting java story errors occur program actually executed known runtime errors right guys seen mixture lets look know different types compiler arabs okay compiler fail variety different ways right example like right like perfectly valid instruction right perfectly valid instruction java compiler right try run know essentially java compiler throwing hands like idea want number weird things guys seen theres formalized know agreement weve java compiler going communicate violates mean day people world working problem trying point actually computer know compilers computer programming languages actually allow know execute instructions like great right wish compiler grade mp0 checkpoint submissions right thank instead know takes couple weeks right right know times actually compiler error different kind compiler wrote valid java syntax compiler identified problem place compiler helps talk compilers help minute compiler going transform code find mistakes mistake told compiler left initialization initializing variable type int right use string literal java compiler saying cant know theres theres bug notice cant dont know convert know change type variable figure way convert string int dont know im going okay despite fact compiler catch certain types errors think going happen okay looks like braindead code right variable called s thats string initialize null talked time fact null object cant including access length property whats gonna happen run lot coffee sick later speak im blaming collectively happened example today runtime error java compiler actually compiled code like hey ahead run happens right wonder right compiler piece computer software argue use case java compiler better right doesnt java compiler know gonna cause problem saw initialize string like dont let friends right mean saw initializes string null try length method line later compiler cant help know thats interesting commentary java language write piece code like compile app deploy app store crash friends phone right want write theres preventing java weird okay things thats actually community programming community trying pure scientist trying work long time figure runtime errors transform compiler errors talked little bit remembers theres points error evanier compile code generated compiler compiler identifies theres wrong error code executed like try example like runtime error like compiler able identify like compiler know cant variables cant use like beneficial yeah yeah question code lets way compiles code think way compiles code like guys apps phone lets lets pick lift lift lyft drivers compiled code compiles code human like compiled want guess mean actually know real person ill impressed right 10 human dont think yeah whats programmer compiled coldblood programmer way like assume probably work lived right lyft built app point know worked bunch changes changing things compiling code point like okay need release weve_got new features want people experience compiled app posted app people compile code developers theyre compiling code time guys working mp youre compiling code multiple_times work time run test suites realize java height know intellij hides time run test suites code gets recompile theres problem compiler identify gets identified quickly imagine wrote code messed know compiler tell right away oh way code unsafe great fix clearly didnt mean dumb code compiled developers gets compiled gets executed remember cant compile cant execute bugs runtime compile time bugs user going experience thats awesome code wild bugs gonna crash user developers compile code users run code developers ones fix compiler errors users ones experience runtime errors manifest crashes freezes sorts bad stuff right runtime errors identify youre compiling developing code fewer users gonna experience awesome ill come question java let okay like small matter big problem okay ashamed 2019 java compiler allow right wrong okay let lets lets introduce java compiler hold sec im gonna switch desktop right awesome im gonna open sort program power tool introduced coders yeah command line im gonna use environment actually know sort lowest level lowest levels interact computer im gonna use environment whats actually happening scenes compile run java code alright thing im gonna im gonna actually run program called java compiler typed java c thats program run arguments gonna information use okay screen sorts information useful actually regular basis time run java compiler instead intellij run prior learning run run exists program right lets compile code alright im gonna edit file called example dot java im gonna java code lets happens okay im im running compiler im telling want compile code thats inside file want compile contents file example java try im gonna theres problem okay things weve hiding point gonna stop hiding week weve allowing write code isnt actually valid java code java compiler required code want run class method inside class okay thing starts line look familiar method things method unfamiliar havent seen static gonna void write method doesnt return arguments method main takes single argument called unused named dont use argument array strings okay lets happens mean things correctly im gonna run compiler okay fun things maybe like psychological things computer scientist lot times run program succeeds happens theres like congratulations compiled code nope like got wanted dont bother want happened created file remember said compiler takes java code let display contents example java thats java source code started transforms different representation different representation called bytecode bytecode whats file dont want display contents file way wouldnt able read readable computer java comes special program displaying contents called class files conversation ladies thanks right heres heres bytecode actually produced printed displayed way help sense dont know dont expect understand want little bit whats going scene okay whats contents bytecode inside class file format way try help understand remember wash didnt tell byte code consists series simpler instructions run java virtual machine okay instructions im gonna dont close time explain second representation code started source code java source code java bytecode okay program run im im gonna use second program told like java second program called java java c java compiler java java virtual machine youll like java c run gives lots arguments run different ways like said program youre gonna typically run said gonna run tell trigger like actually run code heres format oh mad fix oh didnt public alright im gonna add modifier oh want okay modified source code fix problem occurred ran right im gonna run im getting problem im like fixed happening yeah yeah skipped step ive changed source code havent changed byte code need rerun step compiling code scenes run test suites intellij roughly whats happening compiler intellij runs compiler produces bunch byte code separate step runs java executes code test suites run tests code figure happened thats basically whats going run program ive run java compiler step java c ive run second piece software called jonathan want sure clear thing java java c software computer programs written human beings magical dont think theyre written java think written like c like works okay right java c job okay mentioned bytecode innovative features java language introduced idea past compiler produce code directly executable computer processor java widely executed sort deployed languages produce representation unusual time okay java produces bytecode reason yeah reason following true time java came old people remember mac started intel processors laptops remember happening identify whos like older 30 right maybe guys write mean wasnt long time ago period time computer processor ran inside apple computers different computer processor ran inside windows computers types computers problem compile program windows pc tried send friend mac run like written different language think processors speaking completely different languages spoke intel x86 spoke powerpc wrote x86 try read powerpc processor like idea whats going bytecode designed solve problem actually compiled piece code created example dot class file file send room run computer thing java tell find byte code time real selling point java design decision created lot know design decision motivated lot features java slogan write run idea developer write program compile machine send world run long program job java virtual machines people prompted like update java know need update runtime program installed know program installed probably common place java program installed java installed lot computers installed type computer particular billions world lot maybe didnt know know circular kind device runs java probably responsible sort saving java programming language decade android smartphones single android smartphone runs job programs write class written java theyre going compiled java ive seen commercials dont know maybe different ads know son likes brag devices run java theres like know 10 billion devices world run java think like 5 billion android phones places people running okay settle awesome right things thats happened lets fastforward future know little bit java works dama language java compiler old things thats happening compilers computer software single piece computer software riding incredible wave increasing speed power past couple decades know guys lived things think impossible appreciate like trying think age universe like know like billions years way understanding time scale human dissimilar time scales im increase computer performance sense time youve alive time ive alive flabbergasted theres way wrap mind right mean people phone pocket powerful data centers supercomputers 20 30 years ago thats actually true exaggeration right people sorts things right actually true computers stunning things thats getting faster powerful compilers thats important tool youre program compiler better help java finally lately started changes compiler interest let okay actually valid java code people knew okay apcs apparently realize theres java 10 oh okay going okay looks like variable declaration initialization based right feel like integer dont integer thing called bear maybe ive written javascript bringing bad memories bad old days javascript valid java code okay happening example place java compiler starting starting help let ask question int integer value equal 5 replace int placeholder thing double replace right double character string works fine dont change bear possible explain normally job tell im initialization variable tell compiler type dont anymore feature java lot programming languages feature thank super easy dont tell normally lets works right normally int equal 0 sum equal 0 works fine replace works fine dont tell compiler type helping making life easier explain yeah yeah basically let let example sort showed started class right look carefully youll realize im actually telling java type sum twice im telling left declaration im telling right im initializing integer literal keyword java 10 allows compiler whats called local type inference compiler infer type sum im initializing integer literal compiler says ok youre trying stump use keyword exactly sure im told im gonna play variable called sum want figure im supposed guess type alright big clue youve initialized int literal im gonna assign int ya python doesnt types yeah python like know actually actually sorry thats true hite python variable type variable changed point right python people python programmers basically sum equal zero hope changed mind want string good idea ive written lot code languages kind want best worlds actually getting closer able yeah python types internally python type variable change point right theres guarantees going know initialize int theres air guarantees gonna int light okay let point thing dont compiler information local type inference fail going work right reason says infer variable type variable didnt clue didnt initially right says theres initialization im stumped right think actually java 10 compiler dumb yeah like assign minute doesnt okay isnt clue right literally literal value initialization okay let briefly talk main method come week gonna start seeing examples wrote needed write valid piece java code probably noticed quickly things things work wrap class gonna_talk objects week weve hiding purpose second thing use specific function public static void main string array string argument main method java program think run java program start running know start 10 different methods know line code runs starts running gonna run gonna run loops fl statements called function start right java entry point java programs java program need function called main signature thats whats going launch app function starts function needs draw display start communicating network wait users things entry point okay java program start main method second question ill leave exercise listener passed array arguments strings okay questions wrap minutes earlier okay theres exam 1100 whats fix run time runtime error usually theres wrong code need modify code right heres heres better question identify sure users whats tool np sure users dont errors guys day long superg ap test suites yeah testing huge modern software development like know write app big company theyre like oh know wrote like know trevor wrote changes lets push tomorrow happens right netscape thats companies rigorous testing process things actually live right look want know close words encouragement tough point semester understand addition coffee guess guys sick rough dont week midterm fmp 0 thats got homework problems hard imperative programming class gonna hang know putting foot guys gonna fine youre gonna midterm youre gonna great prepare way finish np zero ok monday turn page start talking objects friday discussion imperative programming midterm review thats im gonna agenda basically gonna questions practice problems help prepare midterm np 0 deadline day weekend office hours open today tomorrow great day come quiet friday try leave quickly exam
good lecturer monica going start section statistics heres learning objectives end lecture students able state definition yes theres example population example sample student able classify variable quantitative qualitative nominal ordinal interval going cover lecture im going definitions like said sort relate basic concept youre statistics especially whats difference right gonna population parameter sample youll know mean end finally going classifying levels lets start definition going concepts im going define concept individuals versus know definitions words im going statistics im going examples statistics individuals variables statistics statistics study collect organize analyze interpret numerical information sounds pretty esoteric right actually think simple survey like wiki look yelp right look yelp know restaurant want people stars stars theres stars star mean theres bunch different kind analyze kind statistics science uncertainty technology extracting information words youve got bunch data like restaurant um dont know gonna actually right dont know uh science look yelp youre_seeing everybodys giving star maybe gonna good right dont know maybe theres new thats statistics help decisions restaurant important statistics health care public guess expensive restaurant maybe health care public health need statistics like example lets think center disease control prevention united spend year studying different flu viruses round spend year organize analyze interpret numerical information data different viruses different influenza viruses extract know decisions decisions viruses include year sexy right sure mean year youre like oh gosh everybody know got vaccinated theyre getting sick know sign uncertainty didnt work probably better randomly thats know promised id tell statistics ease version individuals youre outside statistics know individuals people know variable factor like factor vary know like variable dont know time somethings going enter land statistics specific meanings individuals people objects included youre gonna animal study mice randomized clinical trial include people alzheimers patients lot different things study hospitals like rate nosocomial infections case youre looking old bunch stuff hospitals look states rates infant mortality example different states case states slide variable characteristic individual measured examples like saying know wanted study hospital example gave example variable rate nosocomial infections variables individual hospital like rate hospital things statistics sit decide going individuals going measure variables going threw examples different kinds individuals use lot health care public health example variable example theoretically want notice lot times individuals geographic times institutions like said like hospitals clinics theres things kind big um describing review went statistics healthcare disciplines aid decision_making like gave example cdc vaccine important understand statistics need understand processes healthcare like figure like thats important use statistics lot going talk population parameter sample going definition population definition youre sure going talk data population data sample going describing parameters ill lets start population case normal word special meaning statistics group people objects common member group considered population heres theme like nurses work massachusetts massachusetts general hospital population theme list human resources nurse currently employed depend define like said nurses belong american nursing association right wed looking different nurses live new_orleans city limits new_orleans live right looking different details describe theme point describe theme population single sample small portion representative sample biased sample lets think lets going survey sample population nurses mgh lets surveyed nurses intensive care sample representative small portion population probably representative asked nurse want head concept sample small portion portion problem biased think think youve got population variables individual variables chose samples know portion lot work right youd variables individuals theres way fewer individuals probably population data data single individual population thats called im knew person decided survey single professor didnt professors department sent survey single use sample sample data data available individuals researcher described taken list email list professors college serving thats actually commonly research studies especially patients need example kidney dialysis patient study single need im going examples real population data youre probably familiar medicare medicare public insurance program united states grandma medicare alive citizen good job covering elders fact read statistics said 100 people aged 65 download data medicare confidential replace personal theres thing called medicare claims data set single transaction happens like youre medicare treatment insurance claims filed medicare population everybody population united states 10 years government hires bunch people survey bunch send bunch idea try single person united states fill thats called united states im going sort mirror image sample remember talking medicare people enrolled medicare called medicare beneficiaries medicare cares survey sample individuals think im sure phone sample theyre going use statistics try extrapolate knowledge population medicare case notice united states census takes place 10 think changes happen yep lots like think hurricane_katrina thats changed population distribution louisiana vary vary dramatically american community survey government united states census bureau thats conducted sample doesnt know exactly people use statistics extrapolate sample american community want shout statistical capital n like lets sack capital n equals 25 assume 25 means population thats kind secret code use saw lowercase n n equals 25 lowercase assume sample kind like secret code pay im talking n uppercase dont know im talking population im going concept parameter versus statistic want notice word parameter starts p parameter measure describes entire instance come medicare claims data set united states census hand statistic statistic starts s statistic measure describes sample situation word statistic like daily fact hear news like oh look rate hiv africa thats terrible mean parameter theyre talking africa single person africa rate hiv going africa mean parameter dont need heres example parameters statistics based example mean age american medicare parameter thats single remember medicare beneficiary survey thats took mean age people pay attention listen news youll hear use word statistic mean parameter situation youre practicing field statistics important point number youre talking comes population versus comes use parameter population statistic dont youre listening talk lecture video want look clues number population parameter sample statistic hear data set use encompasses entire usually thats kind stuff governments like remember talking rate hiv africa lead probably governments united_nations world health youre talking numbers come entire population usually government thats probably population clues someones talking sample statistic hear talking study recruited volunteers volunteers didnt everybody going like surveys instance surveys people going vote public opinion surveys theyre going ask single person state going vote build ask hear survey tell n equals maybe 1000 people thats thats clue talking sample statistic population im going talk difference descriptive statistics inferential im going remind word infer infer means kind hint kind complement said friend implied 9pm inferred friend inferential im going im going talk descriptive descriptives pretty easy samples populations variables samples populations descriptive statistics involve methods organizing picturing rising information samples basically making pictures right like look bar thats simple data surveying people work data surveying friends theyre going bring download census data descriptive theres special inferential involves methods information sample draw conclusions inferential statistics thats thats called right infer sample going hint population right going directly annoying right thats uncertainty thing sample going imply gonna infer sample population right thats inferential statistics sample infer descriptive statistics loosey samples populations kind like pictures statistics important properly identify measures population parameters sample inferential statistics know youre youre statistics youre talking different types data parameters versus alrighty going classifying variables different levels remember variables right like individuals variables actually fall groups quantitative versus depending group fall classify interval versus ratio nominal versus im going examples classify healthcare data types variables like draw level data classification ill draw start human research data thats like alright going remember said going start talking word thats continuous going use word mean numerical like gives example number think mean quantitative variable right heres example quantitative time admin right imagine work shift er right maybe 8pm like midnight right average time admin got admitted hospital know somebody got admitted like oclock somebody 815 youd average time like study saying patients particular condition like alzheimers disease ask year diagnosis know systolic blood pressure numerical platelet variables run time said quantitative category categorical use term qualitative people use term categorical thats kind quality characteristic like sex qualitative variables healthcare like type health insurance like youre medicare medicaid different types private categorical right cant country youre group students international countries right cant situations numbers involved like stage cancer right thats stage cancer stage cancer stage mean stage cancer wouldnt mean stages 4 course stage lot worse know theyre equal categories trauma center level level trauma center wouldnt mean number term trauma center right like state percent trauma centers level trauma categorical variable theres number alright lets diagram figured variable split categories quantitative numerical qualitative going concentrate quantitative going separate variables going look second going look happen decide variable quantitative interval ratio okay qualitative lets look interval versus left interval quantitative differences data values ratio thing differences data values mean remember talking level trauma center level trauma center categories quantitative variables difference actually especially think job classifications 1234 like nurse nurse nurse nurse worked job office specialist office specialist office know deal going office specialists office specialist hard wasnt hard categorical variable right differences values like difference s s versus oh s s werent youre dealing quantitative variable regardless interval ratio youre talking like years systolic blood pressure year thats fine right heres difference comes interval quantitative variables meaningful differences data values hairsplitting thing interval true ratio true try interval means kind like space like think word intermission kind like like interval time bathroom thats thats space thats going zero doesnt start ratio number dont know remember like high school cant zero ratio thats way use ratio means true work literally lets examples showed quantitative variables right ones decision interval im going remind ratio true remember little pneumonic said like dont divide know like ratio true lets pleasant zero systolic blood pressure youd platelet count possible right interval cant like zero time like time admet know diagnosis theres like year probably guessed theres lot times interval data know anytime time got mind want split quantitative variables interval ratio got mind difference true zero true okay heres handy dandy weve gone tree classifying quantitative data interval versus lets pay attention tree split um split nominal versus nominal applies categories labels names ordered smallest okay like kind think advertisement nominal fee means small theyre like theres thats theres difference smallest largest means thats remember ordinal applies data arranged order remember thing saying quantitative quantitative right difference data values determined meaningless like talking cancer especially know stage stage thats materially different stage cant determine gonna arranged categories ordered smallest remember old friends threw examples qualitative variables healthcare lets reflect nominal ordered like type health insurance country origin ordinal going natural order differences levels meaningless makes different quantitative stays qualitative tree gets labeled want think qualitative variable hands look natural data classified quantitative variable thats split difference quantitative qualitative classify interval ratio nominal important know classify data healthcare youll find depending classify able different things statistics went definition talked little use use especially went means talk population parameter sample statistic went talked classifying variables different levels measurement talked hope enjoyed greetings monica wahi lecturer library college bringing lecture section 2 topic learning objectives particular end lecture students able define sampling frame sampling error student able example simple random example systematic students able explain reason choose stratified sampling approaches state differences cluster sampling convenience sampling example national survey uses multistage lets jump going lecture sampling definitions different types sampling mentioned learning objectives simple random sampling stratified sampling systematic sampling convenience multi state lets start sampling sample okay going revisit concept previous_lecture going talk sampling frames errors mean errors sampling going right sure understand talk different types sample population want inferential statistics remember want infer sample necessary measure population cost actually youll find experiment actually measure population youll find know pretty good proportion population thats needed ultimately save resources especially health care good job sampling use infer population having census brings concept sampling sampling frame list individuals sample actually list physical concrete list like list students enrolled nursing college lecture gave example list nurses work massachusetts general hospital list youd human theoretical like list patients present emergency department today obviously work beginning shift youre going know whos theoretical list sampling people actually selected sampling frame population want draw want work everybody sampling frame chance selected words dont want leave sampling frame leads concept omitting population members sampling frame theyre supposed list happen lets suggesting previous slide got list nursing students know college lets somebody signed day somebody admitted day maybe didnt database time youre like hr list talked mgh know know nurses theyll temp different places maybe theyre payroll maybe theyre temp miss nurses sampling know people present emergency department night different youre trying sample people present emergency department cant look like small period time youd look know 24 hour omit population members sampling frame dont thats called im going shift jumping different going talk took statistics theres actually kinds errors kind terminology fact life error statistics bad case im going called sampling sampling error simply says population mean different sample mean population percentage different sample mean means cut corners like said write sample infer actually experiments telling population data sample compare means okay mean huge coincidence theyre theyre typically percentages know going statistics account ways know theres going sampling error sample population try mean percentage sample going exactly whats populations errors statistics actually means like mistakes literally learning statistics like sit ask somebody fact life errors errors want avoid talked sampling thats fact life errors want avoid non sampling thats basically bad example life wanted study bunch providers friend gave list providers said entire list providers particular professional sent email list found duplicates list lot people emailed said sending im im professional people professional society heard survey emailed said didnt bad people left sampling people society werent email thats problem right pay careful actually mistake pay careful attention population supposed represented sampling frame better job calling professional society making sure list good sampling error caused fact regardless sample perfectly resent represent non sampling error yeah poor sample design sloppy data collection accurate measurement instruments bias data collection problems introduced fault theres non sampling error sampling error fact little whiplash gonna concept simulation defined technically numerical facsimile representation real world like working pretend situation come case know study statistics end lot remember ive talking experiment census bunch data population experiment took sample population looked mean sampling thats example conclude little section important best avoid non sampling achieved making sure coverage sampling sampling puts remember sampling error fact okay going specifically talk different types going start simple random okay gonna start explaining meant simple random sampling going talk different methods simple random sampling work way achieve depending youre research finally limits simple random sampling sampling methods got look lets define simple random heres simple random sample n measurements population subset population selected manner sample size n population equal chance kind complicated means use proper approach simple random sampling sample easily chance getting batch group people words like lets list population students im going define class want sample students bigger simple random sample means different groups students pick list equal chance sample group actually imagine race class right beginning sample everybodys class sound like right sampling frame problem maybe coverage problem maybe biases creeping got careful youre going simple random sampling start list everybody sample frame single sample possibly equal chance ending ill kind explain explaining different methods obtaining best things start good list people maybe know going study work lets going study people active duty army like list people accurate place like unique thats true army everybody army unique numerical like looking students youd maybe student id ids everybody list cut like print cut hat right bag mix draw like picture know mix papers theyre theyre okay sure everybody population id printed cut didnt lose drop floor thats simple random sample got sure hat didnt look draw slips paper drawn meeting simple random okay method work right method_works work better cant id thing cut paper simply list unique random numbers right assign great example youre know kind teaching kids want random order maybe youre gonna like lets 10 kids number 10 hat pull number lets kid right pulling numbers giving kids tell stand order right generate list random numbers long list said 10 kids know 500 names 500 numbers dont okay like smaller id small case randomly assign numbers use hat im big hats know ask stand order figure kind like raffle whos got number know says yes youre like youre lucky study know numbers order thats thatll achieve thing method youll simple random sample different ultimately simple random sample means sample equal chase chance selected hat group people group equal chance youll picture left bingo play know pull balls names ball unique actually letter number thats thats simple random sample bingo balls time bingo described method old fashioned second method know generate numbers sure theyre assign things thats electronic thats example somebody sends excel sheet list ill assign hospital random number sort ill sample thatll simple random sample way im biased picking favorite hospitals friends work right way method second method members population equal probability selected importantly possible samples possible groups equal chance ones werent selected equal chance right probably saw limits list im sampling hospitals right need list hospitals know whos gonna emergency department day youre psychic sample simple random sampling simple random sampling okay got list like hospitals good dont know whos going simple random sampling need good mistake survey bunch professionals professional society sent survey learned people list longer society old importantly people joined society getting like study students know left time students youd great example non sampling youre going simple random sampling need list want research sure best list went characteristics simple random sampling different methods use sample mentioned talk different kind sampling stratified im like simple random sampling steps different steps stratified ill course like simple random sampling stratified sampling limitations ill wanted remind word stratified means strata single word stratum rock slide big horizontal line thats stratum strata right strata rock stay geology thatll geologists explain breaks means happened weather reason picture want sort imagine thats stratified sampling divide list course know list divide list okay remember talking simple random sampling like sample hospitals hospital list divide layers example close city urban suburban rural id stratified students like know year nursing students second year students know id divided um simple random sampling think lets youve got class like statistics maybe lot know theyre year lets small proportion simple random sampling lock youre concerned minority thinks sure representative stratified sampling thing list simple random sample heres step divide entire population list distinct subgroups called remember individual fit somebody whos sort halfway halfway year second year youve got hospital thats kind border got choose got step um step youve got think strata like based got based specific characteristics age income education level know great example people different incomes right thats quantitative variable strata know know um know want sure members stratum stratum share step draw simple random sample like case describing like maybe class year students random sample strata know stratum know youre kind getting like extra votes small minority right like youre kind treating fairly theres way bigger group people youre taking thats risk want sure hear small sample random sampling groups small accidentally examples stratified youll youth behavioral risk factor surveillance surveys high schools theyll stratify grade right simple random sample know lot students drop junior senior year probably freshmen theyre gonna want look getting certain freshman classes certain sophomore classes certain junior classes student run senior classes good estimates hospitals sample providers department right like dont simple random sample providers theyre asking like provider satisfaction know policy wont example miss everybody youre studying know icu multiple icu want maybe stratify icu sure thems smaller sure good good solid representation reasons push stratified situations distinct groups especially little involved want hear everybody want consider stratified course theres ive sort leading end sampling groups usually know like smallest group people stratum big like smallest group having powerful votes biggest group weaker know theyre equal theyre technically equal thats way goes right higher level statistics theres ways adjust sort penalty real pot know extrapolate population proportions possible takes post processing like simple random sampling possible hard actually split list groups lets hospitals didnt know didnt know exactly urban rural adds level complexity stratified summary went stratified means means know putting things groups taking describe steps stratified goes lot lot easily strategist happened equal begin know gave example high schools usually theres maybe slightly fewer people junior senior year kind like youre comparing ice use example ice use roughly size dont worry smaller getting equal going talk systematic okay systematic sampling actually little flexible kind sampling weve systematic sampling easier like define describing im gonna youll understand fact youll understand called list step arrange individuals population particular list order talking example patients coming er come order arranged list right dont know okay step pick random individual lets list hospitals lets sorted state right lets picked random individual maybe went know seven list picked maybe er start seventh patient admitted er pick person picked seven mean picked picked 20 know pick random step step case member population dont try scrabble case word scrabble okay word statistics ease case means spelled k th lets pick number fill lets pick lets pick hospital list patient er doesnt matter number patient comes ask want study hospital original random pick okay going systematic like pretty simple easy list easy dont list deal pick k pick random place start pick k classes list classes available college semester pick random number like know sorted class circle pick random number like pick fifth 45678 910 11 picking okay career okay pick classes alright probably guessed im going negative nelly problems systematic things set boy girl boy girl pick like number youre going boys girls right noticed actually study lab wanted study like assay machines thought assays werent running wanted wanted systematic wanted systematic sample like seven days thats asked colleague lab vary day day assez runs runs sexually transmitted disease assays saves runs im sampling friday thats im gonna right thats actually called dont remember dont think ive seen remember lecture class telling thats worry systematic real common whats awesome clinical sample patients way coming clinic coming central lab like emergency thats particular power particularly powerful way sample ongoing sort patient influx design research simply decide people need recruit sample use systematic sampling somebody clinic inviting case person qualifies case patient qualifies easy systematic sampling easy pick random starting point pick case gonna cluster cluster sampling need kinds sampling went mean use stratified systematic simple random sampling need kind cluster special kind sampling use think theres problem particular geographic typically thats cluster ill imagine example theres particular factory thats believed admit fumes cause problems peoples cant simple random sampling nation right wont people factory cant easily stratified systematic sampling cluster sampling whats designed want study thats coming geographic cluster sampling start dividing map geographic im minnesota know contaminated lot people got didnt know thats think divided minnesota different geographic areas dividing area different geographic areas bad thing bad thing randomly pick clusters areas app like youll screen theres map state virginia divided different cluster highlighted usually probably pick idea try enroll individuals cluster usually people animals theres disease going animals know divide area clusters try measure animals imagine sort practically difficult theres reasons people live right people live mean people dont randomly scattered know cultural communities companies grow art know affluent communities different people communities people located cluster similar way makes problem hard especially youre studying geographic thing like maybe factory sewage plant think causing cancer youre area theres lot pollution things lot low income people youre high income afford theyre exposed higher rates carcinogens probably higher cancer hard tell independent effect thing geographic location similarities cancer ends difficult tough nut high rates lot different geographic issues going cluster sampling doesnt help wrap cluster sampling geography geographically located certain spot cant kind stuck cluster briefly map areas divided different sub areas areas picked randomly people particular area course biased people living know area pick bunch affluent people youll affluent people pick area bunch immigrants hell cluster sampling perfect youre kind theres situation geography long remember live florida wed like drive georgia best pecan thats like type dessert pecans carmel think cluster sampling think pecan clusters theyre good thats way remembering cluster sampling im finally going talk types sampling im going cover lecture convenience sampling multistage theyre little quick im going cover going start talking convenient like right convenient sampling low risk circumstances like findings youre arent like instance lets wanted know ice cream best restaurant hospital lets new restaurant opens youre gonna diet youre gonna ice cream dont want waste want ask people whats best ask coworkers ask know people restaurant hey whats best ice cream results reliable end yelp people convenient sampling basically results data conveniently readily masters degree things surveyed people anonymously coming health fair sat booth gave survey view definitely convenient sample know people showing health useful theres lot resources allocated study like starving masters student right like didnt perfect convenience know questions asking characteristics risk im doctor wasnt wasnt high risk survey convenience sampling convenient uses assembled group surveys like health example ask patients waiting room fill survey ask students class know im teaching ill convenient sample ill hey homework signed week hard dont know um teacher youll want convenient sample gauge classes problems right cant use nice theres bias group right let everybody break whoevers sitting asked thong works hard totally different answer waited everybody know time waltz room like went health fair think bunch sick people theres bunch health minded im gonna bunch bias importantly convenient sampling miss important remember stratified sampling people dont group evenly different strata maybe kind high schools especially comes job classifications usually fewer lackeys bigwigs simple random sample maybe try stratified hand walk break room lackeys hey want fill know work satisfaction ones youre going going lackeys youre going representation upper job classes dont lounge youd thats main problem convenience sample results severely biased youre asking small biased group people probably alike representative im going talk multi stage know kid kids crying somebody like whats kids going thats exactly youre youre multi stage sampling youre going basically like mixing matching different sampling talked stage stages stages stages thats youre imagining got start lot people youre probably right gave example way multistage sampling start stage cluster sample right remember map divide areas lets divide states census regions states like 10 states okay lets stage multistage random sample counties look counties random counties stage stratified sample schools counties totally rural totally urban look schools urban schools rural stage stratified tell stratified sample schools simple random sample counties cluster sample okay got schools stage stratified sample figured urban schools rural schools look classrooms freshman sophomore junior senior stratified basically mixing youre right got start lot begin youre gonna whittle bunch stages doesnt im going real life national health nutrition examination haynes definitely masters centers disease control prevention united states im kind hinting kinds places multistage sampling governments start bunch people things individuals states schools right lot work sampling better good national health nutrition examination survey good thats thats survey thats cdc try measure americas course inferential statistics right taking sample trying extrapolate information got careful sampler cant waltz bunch convenient briefly start stage sampling counties sample called segments defined census different areas segments areas sample thats mean like live live dorm thats household live assisted living thats im apartment building sample knock door household sample individuals use stages thats real life example multi stage summary convenience multi stage sampling respect convenience sampling want avoid low risk question youre want avoid type sampling possible situations patients rare disease probably convenience sampling rare disease clinic resources good reasons try use convenient want use thing youre better look sampling approaches finally multistage sampling usually large governmental dont expect actually design multistage happens showed things survey cdc hundreds people work sampling tons people work try wanted know kind sampling important healthcare happens conclusion sampling lecture didnt started describing definitions needed able understand different types went simple random sampling showed different ways achieves talked stratified sampling got systematic sampling little flexible pretty easy talked cluster sampling need pull tool sampling finally covered convenient sampling multistage hope better understand sampling different types sampling straight hello everybody monica wahi college lecture statistics section introduction experimental learning end lecture able state steps conducting statistical study select step developing statistical study state reason step able common mistake introduce bias survey example able explain lurking variable able define completely randomized lets lecture cover basic going look steps conducting statistical study think theres lot steps conducting study point view okay gonna basic terms youre probably fact statistics certain words mean specific talk bias avoid designing finally talk randomization particular topics need think thinking lets going start course basic terms going review steps talking conducting statistical theres vocabulary vocabulary going talk vocabulary terms im going examples steps basic guidelines planning statistical thing want state know im cant tell times group people curious start thinking lets halfway conversation suddenly hey wait second dont hypothesis whats apotheosis easy scientists forget thats step hypothesis pick hypothesis individuals hypothesis hospitals individuals hypothesis important actually talking patients hospitals talking hospitals sure understand know percolate decide hypothesis actual individuals interest thats youre going marry measure variables step specify variables youre going need measure know course relate good thing step right step determine want use entire population study bunch data like census data use entire typically dont data youre going want sit think youre sitting probably choose sampling method basis talked sampling youve figured hypothesis got individuals figured variables figured youre going census sample youre going sample type sample step think ethical concerns data youre going asking sensitive questions think privacy youre going invasive procedures think painful hard somebody especially theyre know theyre youre experiment unhealthy people better understand sit think ethical change slightly study finally steps taken care thats actually jump collect like saying know meet scientist friends excited talking step like oh realized ended saying hey actually step start talking hypothesis suddenly realized dont know data collect right dont steps order arent step seven data finally use descriptive inferential statistics answer thats finally use statistics write find youre asked little survey happened wanted hypothesis didnt leadership programs werent building good leaders team survey didnt know publish internal report internal report step note concerns data collection analysis know happened recommendations future studies wanted study future groups science usually ends peer reviewed literature report right scientific study maybe step actually prepare journal note concerns data collection analysis gone wrong gone exactly way planned need account properly interpret study want recommendations future studies especially screwed especially answered good reason separate question dont forward lot steps im going help try remember sort lets look clump steps data hypothesis identify individuals interest specify variables lets lets hypothesis air pollution causes asthma children live urban know thats wed stated research question like air pollution cause asthma children live urban case individuals children urban settings variables wed measure air pollution course wed want know things individuals children probably measure income exactly living old theyre male female kinds things kind helps think lets think second steps determine youre going use population sample sample pick sampling method look ethical concerns actually collect quote unquote collect data know like existing data downloading data census like medicare data sets available de identified dont know collect data like survey know bunch patients allow use government data set population dont lot sampling ethics theyve thats kind data time youll especially studying patients treatments cures things like smaller end collecting data sample need choose sampling need consent legally found human want share case didnt know want research humans youre nursing student medical students dental student students dentist physician nurse cant survey study design approval ethical ethical board talk youre considered li li human research need consent patients participants study theyre youre collecting data children example consent parents assent united states way setup called institutional review board protection human subjects research short answer want sure design study know irb thing realize ethical board sure theyre step designing statistical right finally clump steps seven right thats descriptive inferential statistics answer hypothesis collected going step noting concerns data collection analysis making recommendations future kind imagine sitting offices writing research writing internal report bosses writing scientific literature publish point want remind matters picked census sample study pick census youre going certain kind pick sample youre going different kind analysis thats kind cycles study whats important want talk different main types categories different main called experiment treatment intervention deliberately assigned kind imagine enter study assign drug study werent taking thing mean individuals animals getting example hospitals choose hospitals hey need try new policy intervention assigned makes reason experiments purpose study possible effect treatment intervention variables thats option experimental study researcher assigns individuals certain things theres kind study kind called observational way think experiments researcher intervene treatment right observational researcher doesnt researchers enroll study drug supposed eat supposed researcher says going measure going ask questions going measure things going tell different youre observational treatment intervention assigned researcher observational lets youre taking drug know maybe migraines youre taking migraine drug taking stop taking know dont care ask taking drug theyre going observational wanted couple real life womens health initiative slide mainly experiment run united states government course cooperation universities health care centers importantly women america women postmenopausal volunteered study actually separate sections experiment section observational study wanted women qualify experiment purpose experiment study hormone replacement therapy therapy symptoms women theyre postmenopausal therapy good women bad women thought maybe helps post menopause system thought maybe causes cancer right assign bunch women agreeing know assign drug thats problem women qualified separate observational study woman qualify experimental drug assigned observational big government studies know somebody wants study study observational huge popular long ongoing thats observational study run actually started thats called nurses health smart person figured long time ago nurses smart people understand health understand peoples theyre good filling surveys started studying nurses regularly sending surveys course didnt tell didnt assign nurses sort drug diet observe nurses send nurses survey nurses health nurse vault fills think years point want point concept word replication right regular speaking means copy right like know new roommate need replicate copy key new roommate science thing studies rigorously little rigorous study means thats carefully like thinking sampling know like avoiding example non sampling error sloppy getting lot coverage good sampling know im giving examples theres lot things research like eye lot different things want try main reason want somebody tries experiment roughly cant exactly right study hospital somebody wants study hospital theyre going different people right person decides want study hospital study rigorously wont hard person replicate person study thing theres slightly whats replicating results observational studies experiments necessary science youll know lot experiments drugs approved given everybody cant study replicate sure findings sort coming deduce information dont want rely study went steps need follow statistical study actually follow determine type study youre know experiment observational theres ton study got going talk avoiding bias specifically survey lot different kinds lets talk surveys happens lot nurses interact patients lot gather information interactions attitudes healthcare system functions surveys provide lot information useful important aspects survey design administration youre giving got think minimizing bias try know try representative sample trying accurate want think non response voluntary response okay talked lot sampling previous_lecture invite participate study like maybe youre systematic sampling patient asked like fill survey doesnt mean theyre going right person says thank sample thats called non helping survey said hey getting lot non response look proportion approach 200 people 80 said know thats 20 response rate 80 non response people refusing survey actually completed likely biased ive noticed situations things bad like remember going subway station flooded bad man handing surveys transportation like survey everybody waving didnt want grab know got bleeding heart took survey know think transportation authorities right lived florida theres transportation right massachusetts got great transportation system flooded doesnt work half time way better im grabbed survey bunch nice pollyannas like grabbed probably trent transit authority thinks everybody loves subway everybody waving past poor guy disgusted station right people refusing survey high proportion feebly actually fill going kind weird probably know youre gonna bunch happy people people said sad reason completing survey feel terms lets want talk drinks night okay think lot people struggling alcoholism gonna want fill survey know illegal drugs illegal activity people dont feel good know people fill survey necessarily people engaging fact freedom choose want survey researcher standpoint low response rates need ask responding know missing good share opinion people respond got careful respondents lie youve got pretty cool survey suddenly ask question thats people ask maybe students youre sin know maybe satisfaction survey desk runs know ask question cheated test know everybodys probably ask question people dont know answer offhand theyre like ask somebody know youre know asked kid whos living house forever parents bought house cost mean theyre gonna maybe theyll know want careful design questions youre asking thats personal everybodys lie youre asking question trump people try accurate theyre probably right answer hard um respondents know surveys lie meaning like ask question happened long time ago theyre probably going called recall bias like know like look time life like especially went harsh like sports team went state tough dont remember tough right sit singing know sports songs hey thats recall bias right winning state looks know bus wasnt people tend recall bias influenced events happened original youre giving people survey youre saying applied nursing school know think think know tell think theyre telling truth theyre actually actually managed time ask tell kind screw data screwing want think word screw questions introducing hidden happened recently company sent free said try free app downloaded month later sent questions use app know time day use right like use read scientific literature read news problem couldnt day right question wording induce certain asking use didnt choice dont know mean honest careful arent rosy topic assume everybody mean youve got questions like software problems software right im assuming theyre know like supposed big order questions wording induce certain response youll lot public opinion lot polling wed ask questions like likely vote candidate x know likely likely somewhat unlikely likely people dont know youd knew candidate x supported new proposition proposition right likely vote candidate x thats order questions wording theyre trying add fact fact going person like candidate think order want ask different subjects kind think subject come color respondents answering subsequent slide wanted point scales questions accurately measure feelings fit scale know yelps kind peoples feelings restaurants tend fit scale id lot trouble filling gave scale people granular feelings things maybe need longer scale um youll lot pain scales offer choices probably pain maybe seven think scales youre creating questions thats choice youre designing point influence dont interviewing going days internet anonymous surveys people fill self report robo phones automated voice thats obviously person survey theres situations actually interview people especially somebody sick bed phone interview people hear voice got think youre pairing whoevers interviewed whoevers interviewing um ive found best interviewer come population research participant general time problem thirst community theres privacy helpful interviewers actually population studying know individuals instance need interview bunch young african american know like african american teenage men like recently saw study health care united states isnt needs improve needs better cater lets wanted better understand best thing hire young african american male train good interviewer good data collector probably best data hand lets think different ways person older maybe different race maybe change young african american male respond mean interviewer like ways like respondent respondents perception change answer verbal nonverbal influences matter know clothing setting persons im saying theres im saying good like remember working data set questions asked older men sexual looks data look funny statistician data collection told chosen young female nursing students interview men sexual said know subject interviewer course worry vague looks clear doesnt mean looks simple ways avoiding vague terms survey instead asking person theyve waited long time waiting room 10 exactly like month certain certain activity year expect change try use numbers specific know instead clinic public health clinic particular youre going pretty accurate youre stuck vague terms youre studying vague terms right study controllable lifestyle attitudes controllable lifestyle medical asked question important having controllable lifestyle future career mean thats pretty use grounding anchoring language added sentence controllable lifestyle defined allows physician control number hours devoted practicing talking kind wofully watery loosey goosey like control lifestyle knows means thats sentence interpreted differently people youre stuck vague wording try grounding everybodys sort led direction thought answer want point probably noticed theres issues think surveys theres issue called lurking variable know lurk means sneak scenes right scenes lurking variable variable thats associated condition actually remember studying epidemiology talked lot people motorcycle accidents unfortunately got motorcycle accidents said everybody shouldnt tattoo motorcycle accident thats great example lurking yeah lot people motorcycle accidents tattoos tattoos dont um know having education increases income people education level income theres thing know called called matters youre woman man matters color know youve got darker skin doesnt matter education somebody lighter skin youre gonna lurking variables people looking people know making income theyre educated got look lurking current studies women african americans money explained fewer working fewer getting lurking got think guess survey youre studying lot lurking variables associated sure measure like early studies looking drinking lot alcohol causes lung forgot study people know smoking causes lung know youre hanging place lot drinking allow smoking youll lot people hand dont want miss measuring variables think lurking problem measure use later sure theyre final note bias want point survey results healthcare progression science owe simplest survey think things possible things wrong wording questions youre approaching things consider important pay attention avoiding bias youre designing conducting think things design finally ill section lecture randomization think lot im going explain steps completely randomized im going talk concept placebo placebo going briefly touch blocked randomization define meant randomize right randomizing bunch respondents participants study randomly choose remember like talking experiment versus observational study cant observational definitely experiment youre telling group randomization assign individuals treatment randomly assign youre assigning youre randomly assigning youre picking know youre like dice sort random method helps prevent bias selecting members distributes lurking variables evenly dont know lurking variables arent randomization method equally allocated remind actually remember steps statistical study point ethical approval thats start data collection thats start recruiting sample know hanging signs saying study people come qualify qualify youve got group sample people thank measure confounders word lurking measure outcome youre trying study youre randomized experiment know ive involved lot theyre studying drugs lowering blood theyll maybe groups groups theyre randomizing people dont thing everybody measure blood pressure right outcome know want know going measure confounders like smoking remember smoking good blood pressure know things good blood pressure like exercising measure okay heres thats randomization showed picture dye usually use got know randomly different example slide going pretend theres fact cant study blood pressure going group treatment group placebo inactive treatment fake doesnt course treatment placebo going look people taking know going dont wont reason real life cant blood pressure study today know high blood pressure unethical placebo got sort drug lower blood usually studies like blood pressure new blood pressure drugs group treatment group b old treatment like usually new treatment group old treatment group b find better talking like timers especially late stage old timers theres okay whats group gets treatment group b gets sham pill placebo ethical lets cross fingers someday thats ethical anymore treatment groups sort missing slide time passes people group theyre supposed example slide people group b fake treatment placebo know usually knows whats takes olden days knew high blood pressure study ended happening beginning measured confounders outcome everybody high blood pressure treatment group group group b little bit cboe effect ill explain thats learned blood pressure different finally time passed weeks years long took passed wed measure confounders outcome example blood pressure know alzheimers promised slide talked placebo placebo effect found great picture old placebos national institutes placebo fake drug thats given actually kind hard imagine drug need excetera imagine study wed fake excedrin tasted like look people randomized placebo group able totally tell placebo group thats reason need placebo theres thing called placebo occurs treatment participant assumed receiving treatment responds talk favorite epidemiologists comedians ben goldacre reported think ted talks study everybody enrolled um didnt disease right guess mild told everybody going going pill thats placebo theyre going thats placebo injection found groups people got injection people know fake injection people got fake pill placebo pill second best people didnt didnt point thats placebo effect reason getting sailing think getting sort drug psychologically affects thing taking dont know youve seen kids know saying oh need medicine 90 parent gives mm right think pill theyre actually placebo effect cause real effects health feel better think youre taking thats super important include placebo group dont comparison group like described blood blood pressure studies group theyre taking theyll good water placebo given whats called control group receive youre studying like acupuncture cant placebo theyll theyll sort hang hang little curtain kind tap dont know youre getting real called sham things happen like youre studying interventions arent called attention controls right like sham case youve got think need controller comparison thats youre testing experiment randomized experiment new thing promised id talk little bit blocked randomization randomize right know group people theyre youre gonna split group group b ones gonna maybe drug maybe gonna worried groups going unbalanced respect particular lurking blood pressure wed care smoking want equal smokers know lot times care gender want equal amounts men women youre worried randomization cant time randomly men block drew blocks screen youll theres theyre blank study blank enroll people remember measure sure qualify study write blocks fake initials know lets xyz came thats woman maybe nsw came thats woman putting men come fill blocks heres trick actually randomize entire blocks right block block ended group magic got equal men group b equal men thats know theres limitation like multiple races study maybe know racial block youve got fill block know youre youre area certain racial groups trouble filling theres mentioned situation dont want youre going experiment right observational study youre going randomize people drug sort intervention versus placebo drug versus drug old drug dont want know group mean enter study tell youre gonna group groups got tell youre going know group youre wallets blinding person deliberately told treatment biased reporting study actually doesnt participant study researched like common participant blinded treatment ive studies ive worked studies like alzheimers disease right theyll want patients participants study alzheimers disease look image mri theyll neurologist interview theyll neuro want different groups imaging group neuro psychology group neurology group know opinion particular theyll blind blinding ar complicated blinding participant theyre placebo theyre drug double blind important means participant study staff know treatment everybody whos operating patient doesnt youre probably thinking thats pretty right like person gets sick goes emergency room theyre taking experimental drug taking placebo knows theyre taking case happens theres unblinding procedure set somebody goes emergency room theres person called pate participant whos patient theyre unblind learn taking placebo right study staff fact tried things double blind makes things biased 10 session randomization purpose randomization testing treatments especially reduce especially particular variable youre concerned like gender like talking race smoking smoking status use block randomization blinding prevents bias right people dont know theyre taking study staff dont know theyre reason think blinding placebo effect necessary account youre going placebo effect time youve got account study conclusion went steps conducting statistical study order kind tips remember looked basic terms talked avoid bias survey design theres lot different finally talked depth specifically randomization know lot hope enjoyed hi whoa monica wahi statistics lecturer labarre going cover didnt cover lecture chapter 1 frequency histograms learning objectives end lecture able state steps drawing frequency histogram able types distributions explain look able define outlier reason frequency finally able define relative frequency cumulative okay lets going review frequency histograms relative frequency youll figure im going common distributions statistics know im going talk youll notice lot pictures presentation reason remind lets talk frequency frequency histogram important statistics youll need order im going explain like looks ill ill explain relative frequency looking need heres skyline looks like frequency histogram actually specific type bar data frequency frequency histogram looks like boring old bar old bar graph got specific properties im going talk frequency histograms relative frequency histograms bar charts special bar charts certain theyre way histograms reveal distribution data ill explain frequency fake patient transport miles youll notice class limits frequency threw relative okay frequency table im going use demonstration frequency histogram need frequency okay heres histogram version whats frequency im going annotate image explain order draw basically thing draw vertical line y axis okay draw write words line start frequency example patience im telling need order youll start line write draw horizontal line x axis write remember like lowest class thats lower class upper class limit lowest class like literally write freaking order totally confused y theres totally try number flip okay step use drawn like basic background youve got x y axis start drawing bar look class find frequency table think look y axis want label y axis maximum incorporated like maximum wouldnt want end y axis 20 15 bigger 14 draw horizontal line 14 right horizontal line gonna bar draw vertical lines position labeled makes bar actually color bars like repeat class right thats labeled classes x axis need prepare frequency know graph know graph okay relative frequency histogram understand relative frequency right proportion proportion sample thats change youre going relative frequency histogram basically steps youre changing whats y axis change label okay x axis youre youre charting relative frequencies like youll like okay totally different number youll pattern takes similar pattern pattern actually going thats thing im going talk disparate tend prefer pattern going come tend prefer relative frequency histogram versus frequency different groups like lets hospitals gathered sets data wanted compare models transported use relative frequency histogram patterns evident compare fairly like whatevers 35 know point hospital maybe tons transports like compare percent thats lean relative frequency ultimately youre going pattern histogram use frequency relative picture think skylines look like histograms right making frequency table quantitative data right youre trying organize important frequency histogram relative frequency histogram reveals thats going going talk im going define im talking youre gonna lot kinds pictures like right shape thats distributions thats little prequel im going talk im going describe outlier detect finally im going wrap explaining cumulative frequency old okay distribution thing talking actually shape draw line edges histograms bars left drew scribbly youll notice stem data graphed right stem im know recycling old drawing squiggly line thats actually mean dont look exactly thats draw line know kind odd thats distribution theres actually use theres way actually statistics kind higher level statistics care going called normal called noticed book mound shaped symmetrical distribution im going normal theres normal named theres uniform distribution skewed left distribution skewed right distribution modal distribution going lets start normal right somebody squiggly actually histogram drew squiggly notice squiggly line looks like kind looks like book called mound shaped thats shape normal distribution looks like got kind hokey things mound thats histogram ends looking like kind like little mountain like youve got normal okay lets look different okay histogram youll notice like bars frequencies like doesnt matter class like little line draw squiggly dont healthcare happen kinds data called uniform distribution makes sense bars uniform thats uniform okay kind like looking looks kind like slide like playground know like climb right slide okay like low high called problem way skewed right remember way skewed skewed light short light skewed left right left bars imagine whats going come look skewed right light short skewed technically mean skewed like like explain people dont know way left remember light left light finally bi word mode areas statistics engineering stuff means like high modal means high looks like camel little hard tell modal remember normal like lets normal distribution little little bar kind middle youre like bi modal normal tell coach people bi modal theres big space humps thats apparent youll class class theyre short called normal ive seen modal distributions comes like lab data best friend pathologist hell know situations people like super high platelet counts like platelets practically theres thats youll bi modal gonna_talk outliers data values quote different measurements whats different right like people statistics come different formulas try figure different talk actually later later chapters class identifying outliers better understand quick dirty representation obvious outlier lit like disagree youll notice threw classes youll class class theres like theres suddenly theres class big gaps kind like platelets like telling maybe know tri modal like theres modes theres modes right theres wacky low wacky high class class theyre far away whats middle like statistician agree imagine argue actually especially hard youre getting data weight people weigh 400 500 maybe 600 pounds dont know theyre outliers data theyre real maybe high unfortunately low main points histogram look distributions youve got super obvious outliers youre gonna think proceed im going talk cumulative frequency means know word accumulate means like accumulating things like gutter house accumulate leaves like old leaves sit new leaves coming old ones like totally clogs gutter thats cumulative frequency accumulates slide know class ate frequency cumulative frequency like leaves beginning season thats got add class add cumulative frequency accumulates add 21 14 youve got extrapolate walk classes eventually total yeah thats class frequency cumulative frequency equal ill healthcare dont use cumulative frequency lot youll relative frequency ill groups cumulative frequency like plot plot called ill honest healthcare ive seen old giant scientific literature youll nfl teams salaries think use lot rate youll classes x axis know youre thats frequency y axis numbers called cumulative graph right things youll notice going like going class zero going going youll sort shape like going end hits total cumulative frequency review main types distributions emphasize mean theres ones ones going thats histograms seven leaf displays looking looking finally quickly shout oh jive cumulative know conclusion purpose histogram reveal distribution stem leaf displays reveal look youll probably wondering work reveal distribution youll find later chapters matters kind distribution kind statistics insert way know like went kind normal like statistics partial allows bunch different statistics know pretty easily normal whats happens healthcare ive skewed distribution left skewed right skewed decisions makes little ive buy moral distribution im remembering day kind issue thats roughly chapter figure later ill explain hello monica wahi labarre college statistics going circle chapter talk graphs im things little order makes hope makes lecture going learning youre lecture able describe case time series graph appropriate able explain difference graphed bar graph versus time series graph able describe type data graphed pie able list considerations choosing type chart alright lets im going lecture im going explain time series im going talk bar course im going roughly im gonna explain pie im going review graphs ive talked summarize use type lets start time series actually word time time going talk time series graph time series data little example time x thats kind hint okay ill roughly ill explain time series graphs like course im mm mortality heres nice time series graph wonderful graph percentage visits influenza like illness reported outpatient influenza like illness surveillance network surveillance week october 1 2006 1 youre like oh time yeah thats time series data measurements variable individual taken intervals period case example individual person right remember individuals measure youre measuring individuals actually weeks right week theyre making like said time series data measurements variable percentage visits influenza like week went dont know like clinics outpatient influenza like illness surveillance network lets pretend theres like 10 week clinics yeah example 100 visits week 10 influenza like week got clinics found y axis right theres percentage x axis weeks um youve seen right especially stock market right yahoo look favorite stock right know rich stock track favorite stock personally im spend time looking mortality morbidity things like influenza hey money ill looking stock market time series data graphed time series graphs things like influenza rates youll life expectancy rates heart thats usually trying affect trying theyre im going roughly wanted thing need table kind like right data dont roughly need column says case year influenza people week like regular time increments variable measured time lets today youre like oh want measure times went gym week know weekly months youre gonna reconstruct data right like maybe memory normally youre going time series stuff start collect nice okay lets managed time series data plot thing im influential thing example draw horizontal line x axis gathered data based years label time periods know time label x draw vertical line y youve measurements right measuring times went gym week know maybe day know seven maximum right didnt want sure y axis tall good thats youre looking y axis dont want tall like highest point ooh 2009 outbreak needed sure y axis tall dont want sure im big labeling people okay going step actually putting weeks like look like 2007 like x axis inches like 52 weeks 2007 literally looks like super smooth honestly went point separately connected thats looks points wider x axis itll choppier itll look little bit like theyll stock graphs like kind look like roller coaster lot points mission ends looking wanted point line set data like theyre comparing dont know sort book performance versus canada sure legend people tell lines summarize time series graphs useful understanding trends time like things like saw influenza chart apparently kind epidemic graphing set time series data like saw graph graph help comparing differences datasets worked theres lot problems people getting injured lot time series graphs rates injury years trying things rates way trend actually thats main goal time series im going talk bar graph display quantitative qualitative im going start features bar heres example im going talk going talk happens change scale meaning x axis like tall x axis bar chart changes bar chart bar theyre dont know chose graph finally theres want little shout purrito charts dont use healthcare wanted alright lets look features bar thing want know bars vertical dont im showing horizontal vertical example dont thrown horizontal regardless theyre vertical horizontal bars supposed uniform width uniform spacing cant wider spaced apart uniform im gonna use like said big example talk bar graphs want notice percentage people covered health split race looking years 2008 2012 like bad right like want people health okay um item says length bars represent variables frequency percentage looking instead percent like ive circled percentage thats looking looked know number visits health care clinic frequency havent looking youll y axis measurement long write use measurement scale graphing bars fulfilling item measurement scale dont know anybody thats features bar feature like pet peeve irritated find bar graph graph things labeled totally want title need bar labels app x axis right like know says white black like wouldnt know bars somebody people add actual values bar ill theres space like gets busy um kind youre probably wondering um youre probably kind having flashback youre like looks totally like difference started talking histograms theyre actually special case bar graph right bar graphs histogram specific type bar histograms bar graphs classes quantitative variable x bar graph im showing histogram says categorical qualitative things doesnt class right histograms frequency relative frequency y axis isnt histogram youre making kind special bar wanted point werent said going warn goes wrong change mean changing scale look y axis notice way person 35 notice highest racial group health insurance unfortunately hispanic origin thats close way im exactly sure wanted happen shape change bars actually regenerated youll kind subtle suddenly bars look bigger right like advocate running saying terrible know people dont id like look left know way thats little misleading right differences bars dramatic change scale shorter little bit lets way people things lets happens y axis right lets lets lets differences bars look small right like difference big hispanic origin lower white asian ones isnt big opponents look fact looks kind graph oh theres problems um thats know people talk lying statistics speak mean kind tricks people try change things best way kind suggested look use y axis army looking rate knee injury rate ankle knee injury way wanted compare use scale people wouldnt able ankle injury compared knee injury theyre um lets hall taller y axis differences bars look dress dramatic taller y axis looks like bars got dont know people theyre trying term mentioned book term clustered clustered bar complicated means bar graph youll look right course mixed little horizontal life expectancy separated youll theres sets bars right theres sexes theres bunch legend hispanic non hispanic black non hispanic white mix races separate set bars male need legend people tell whats youll notice know life expectancy thats high right want live 8090 look slide x axis mean started zero long fit theyll theyll little hash marks little squiggle indicate skipped like said skip ahead female skip right skipped fair like sort like fast forwarding movie looking differences thats thing scale notice clustered youve got legend look okay im going shout purrito probably noticed dont use healthcare example causes engine dont lot youll kind slapped label y axis word frequency perrito chart remember saying histogram special bar chart bar graph pre chart different kind special bar height bar indicates frequency like look events like damage radiator core happened 31 times right happened faulty fans happened 20 figure happened second deliberately arranged order left right according decreasing way sort zoning important problem youre meant graph frequencies actually saw purrito chart ive healthcare far things happen bad nursing remember tallest bar falls right like people fall nursing smaller bar medication errors reason dont think reason dont use lot healthcare know lets pretend thats lets pretend 31 instead damage radiator course 31 falls thing youd probably ask people nursing home know long collect data right 31 falls pretty hundreds people 10 years 31 falls youre reason dont use preto charts lot healthcare sort leaves important information like look things different summarize bar graphs bar graphs following rules talked know know width label know youre visualize quantitative qualitative data bar labels important scales right like showed change scale things look want careful shout purrito charts explained think theyre going jump pie know thought pie chart makes hungry doesnt um heres pie theyre called circle theyre counts frequencies mutually sounds means individual fall im going example right actually real report probably survey massachusetts nursing association got 339 nurses fill survey questions receive annual blood borne pathogen training answer going cant mutually exclusive answer 234 people said yes 105 said bad im pie charts graphing programs theyre little difficult ill unlike peredo charts super common healthcare right lets look features pie um actually fake pie chart pretended class gave point quiz right reason wanted quantitative remember thats answers nurses survey actually know fake students points quiz classes right like zero points points points points regardless youre yes qualitative know different categories like youre classes like individual data categories classes kind like frequency tables everybody gets thats important pie chart qualitative quantitative youll later fake example pie chart quantitative im gonna briefly hand im realizing ive use excel probably recognize lovely purple color comes going hand guess youd buy things lower left protractor helps degrees remember circle 360 degrees right dont know remember like like half circle 182 thats figure like piece pie need youre going pie chart hand table youll tables constantly class column required class nurses saying yes category yes right total course total add try sure know fake class apparently 37 want sure know adds step room remind relative frequency figure proportion circle thats going points seven people got points divide seven 37 youre going point thats like thats proportions circle finally column remember telling circle 360 degrees proportion multiply 360 figure degrees youre going thats need thats use excel makes dont worry need excel actually class categories use automatic pie graph function stuff wanted notes pie thing im coming mutually exclusive want imagine survey asked question favorite color choices like red green blue theres going answer everybodys question right favorite right eligible pie chart everybody gets lot times ill people different survey question theyll check colors im like oh love like orange like green im checking theres people know dont like color like gray probably wouldnt people people multiple votes situation like telling people multiple things youve got bargraph land okay bunch people like read bunch people like green bunch people like wont everybody answers everybodys mutually exclusive category use pie wanted let know find think lot people informative percentage actual chart frequency people frequency percentage good helpful frequency nursing report dont know know 234 like proportion circle thats kind want look right like instance 5 god zero point thats small right know 5 means hard tell know look left looks little like thirds dont know percent helpful include title youre youre graphing pie chart youre gonna category people gonna want know color looks good doesnt look um pie charts common healthcare graph mutually exclusive okay youll like said easier software use excel come software like excel fancy labels squiggle thing choosing graph requires consideration like actually want pie chart bar chart requires regardless chart follow provide title okay private trust im like dont know time sit write little remember labeled think youre going remember maybe think obvious everybody audience going tell dont leave assumed absolutely clear whats identify units youre talking rate 10000 people percentage maybe youre talking average youre talking frequency doesnt matter sure youre clear youre units measure usually ends y thought graph clear possible thinking font size thinking number items graph know ive seen bunch time series graphs lines theyll tiny font theyll try hard find trouble reading probably want throw tell whats missing graph graph missing lot mean dont know kind guess time series graph right person knew talking dont dont want happen okay im going review different graphs ive talked chapter talk cases graph straight heads graphs theres frequency remember quantitative thats want distribution right remember distribution frequency histogram particular type bar graph meant showing showed relative frequency histogram thing graphs relative frequency instead distribution right ones specifically good comparing sets data maybe different locations different groups want use relative frequency histogram easier compare distributions showed stem leaf display explained stem leaf leaves thats quantitative thats want distribution good organizing data little easier hand histogram makes frequency table stem leaf display kind skip trying quantitative data visualize look distributions look went time series time right thats graphing variable changes measured regular intervals mainly trends like going going epidemic thats time series graph bar generic bar graph specific histogram like described generic bar graph qualitative data quantitative displaying frequency percentage went shouted perrito chart special bar graph special bar graph graphs frequencies rare events descending order usually bad things know rare bad dont use finally went pie thats mutually exclusive categories quantitative use lot conclusion particular lecture went time series graphs explained changes went bar graphs showed display quantitative qualitative showed different went pie charts looking mutually exclusive categories think favorite like look makes um end important pick right want useful visualization youre trying look choose right kind visualizations right kind graphs want instead look trends choose right kind gave mouth im gonna eat yoo hoo monica statistics lecturer labarre college decided chop chapter lecture going chapter 1 frequency tables entire chapter 3 stem leaf learning objectives end lecture able state steps making frequency table defined class upper class limit lower class limit able explain relative frequency useful comparing able state steps making stem leaf finally able describe difference ordered ordered sounds foreign dont worry youll understand end introduce im going cover im going define frequency table ill explain help understand im jumping right stem leaf display main reason combine feel like stem leaf displays help frequency connection im lets start frequency know think frequency think radio right like think rem whats frequency kenneth think okay thats talking frequency like word frequently like frequently work week count times work class week frequency like frequently like frequent im going explain frequency table im going define terms defined frequency im going define youre going need im going explain steps making frequency table relative frequency remember quantitative data ill remind qualitative data thats like gender race diagnosis individuals quantitative data remember like age heart rate blood want calibrate idea frequency table thing thing quantitative entire lecture actually focusing quantitative data qualitative quantitative data probably noticed youve right like lets lets yelp know tried decide bunch fives fours threes twos stars know know pile organize im going like totally fake example okay im pretending 60 patients studied distance needed transported far needed transported ambulance picked actually got shortest transport fake data minimum mile thats kind happens live right near hospital hopefully dont need thats happens urban centers longest transport maximum 47 miles want point happens people rural areas lack kind realistic fake hard look pile understand data im going start word class means interval remember talking quantitative lets people got transported 30 40 miles class 30 40 class limit lowest highest value fit carrying example class randomly picked 30 class 30 lower limit 40 upper class sense course width class class thats wide carrying example upper class limit 40 lower class limit 30 minus 30 40 add n equals thats little youre like count fingers 3031 32 6034 blah blah blah youd realize 11 frequency like sort quickly explained values data fall patients transported 30 40 way saying look data find single person got 3031 3233 blah blah blah 40 count people frequency okay probably realize need decide classes counting frequencies need know lower upper class lets talk rules classes width 30 40 40 42 right 41 42 right cant skinny class fat class um different ways pick right class width determined empirically isnt fancy word empirically means choose like look survey data look quantitative variable age youll slide classes 18 2425 3435 right like thats means empirically picked youre probably noticing 18 25 18 older classes arent equal ones middle right like whats upper class limit 65 older okay thats normally happens world especially healthcare healthcare pick classes technically supposed width guided scientific youll later videos want able compare find people dont want cut classes different ways hard book teach class formula heres class formula dont healthcare statistics im going calculate number find maximum data youre minimum data subtract minimum example giving fake data transport 47 maximum step got okay looking formula divide got number classes words like know categories want want like dont want 10 know 34567 usually range good number lets pick 46 number got divided formula decide class width increase number lot people confused ive gotten like low like 1 id increase like integer know thats number integer class class um described class im going use example dont healthcare makes actually kind hard understand want thats little intuitive like look slide right know 20 miles 21 2930 39 40 little sense know thats think like 18 24 25 29 know dont think helpful healthcare boil way writing real paper sort real data id looking papers talked transport times looking class okay frequency table displays class frequency number data points class class limits left simple frequency table know classes frequencies right youll notice add 60 measured 60 fake patients good little dont want double count people classes selecting arbitrary class limits frequency table words empirical thing sort weird 20 big 40 miles bigger kind breaks rules class following scientific literature results comparable science thats sort flail book class formula im im going example frequency health carry know glucose measured blood expressed milligrams 400 milliliters right glucose huge molecule cleared blood especially youre eating youre putting glucose body supposed like problem people dont metabolize glucose know thats care glucose sitting peoples blood glucose levels random sample 70 women recorded 12 hour got got minimum 45 maximum picked set class class demonstrate know sort comes little got frequencies example time class width formula classes sure covered youll notice start minimum like 45 end maximum thats clearest typically read like scientific literature healthcare dont frequency tables labeled wrap sure data points accounted use class formula use empirical arbitrarily picked classes single data point gets vote dont want leave data want sure happens need sure classes cover data healthcare thing 20 stuff cause youre going use class formula pay attention minimum want sure classes cover like mentioned sure total classes frequencies classes adds total_number data points little check sure didnt im going talk relative frequency builds learned know theyre like family right relative means relationship rest data okay statistics use fancy f stand ive mentioned sample size sample use lowercase use formula relative frequency f divided youre clever math realize means frequency classes know portion sample divide total sample n youll proportion values class relative frequency useful frequency youll kind crammed right old frequency table showed glucose crammed relative super easy calculate like example 45 55 frequency pull old calculator actually use divided 70 got oh point dont like proportions thing decimal places right percent like 4 70 people thing happened took know 56 66 took seven divided 70 came percents im percents like moving decimal think 10 equal like proportion land 100 youre like like percent case relative frequency table column super easy pile quantitative data hard organize thing select class talked ultimately lower upper class limits need determined column frequency second column frequencies count class column dividing thing relative thats thats build frequency future lectures youll table like given quantitative data kind gets place helpful organize im going talk stem reason picked theme organizing quantitative im going talk stem leaf plot heres example youll find feels lot like making frequency instead frequency table food things got hung took biostatistics fact called stem example stem called seven leaf theres thats corn stalks im minnesota im seeing youll notice theres stem right like big corn stock stem thing vertical line bunch numbers left stem leaf plot called leaves added sim tally length sense right essentially end adding leafs like theres little leaf theres big long leaf bunch im making help understand wanted picture actually kind hard understand whats going stem leaf understand vertical line numbers left considered things build start know numbers called people talk leaf okay im making data right decided data 42 patients visited primary care clinic referred mental reason update subject im upset think people waiting long mental health especially youve following news veterans lot people hold primary know theyre waiting lists dont like fake data demonstration highlight okay data number days referral mental health lets january 1 10 days later actually clinic right thats lets right slide pile numbers people came got like look person wait month mental health look know person needed 12 thats sort consume fake youll left blank doesnt numbers knew need vertical okay lets build start number thats whats awesome start want kind cross start youll went stem left stem zero right begins leaf heres like right kind imagine gonna walk like seven right start alrighty number youll started leaf youre starting pattern right probably guess whats going happen start okay leaf weve started right add leaf leaf started 30 beginning heres 47 pile youll notice tried line seven leaf youre hand youre hand things lined wont good stem im going fast forward little little probably imagine row want happens special okay thing special youll notice 38 got leaf 36 got know second 29 look gonna know think leaf thats right right thats figured add zero look guess tack zero add zero probably figure want talk happens stem adding leaf got careful end situation got big feel sorry fake 51 days mental health appointment thats long right causes later cause real estate problems especially piece paper know right paper right kind hard maybe tape paper problem um youll slide got later 70 id add seven want reason state didnt leaf place thats know missing leaves need place heres heres gonna learn outliers pretty long 105 days kind like va status right youll course fake data unfortunately reflects real youll 105 skip leaf leaf need leave space 10 went 200 300 mean wait long digits like 365 36 365 alright little demonstration explain certain nuances stem leaf encounter im going reflect ways ive described lecture organize quantitative showed frequency need need set classes class count frequencies lot theres lot pre processing lot pre calculations want think youre dont want youre trying stem leaf fly dont need set classes class noticed went line pile numbers crossed stemmen need count tally data list know course pretty clever saying basically youre forcing stem leaf class know 10s right know 20s 30s thats like leaf leaf yeah kind like simplified way making kinds case wanted alert wanted highlight im going tricks want tell concept unordered unordered leaf making demonstrating numbers order leaf like youll leaf seven order 2779 right like come seventh leaf thats order zero fine doesnt come right thats problem unordered making unordered version rewrite stem leaf ordered rewrote leaf theyre leaves okay stem unordered way demonstrating rewrite ordered way easier count frequency table matter classes leaf super easy frequency thats combined pieces chapter wanted use stem leaf help frequency stem leaf way organize quantitative easier kind fly frequency table requires help data order like preparation frequency table started help step sure remember emphasizing frequency table reflect data class blah way sure happens pre organization ordered stem conclusion frequency tables stem leaf displays organize data organize quantitative stem leaf help frequency want purpose things reveal thing called im going explain hello monica lecturer library college moving chapter 1 measures central learning end lecture able explain calculate able describe mode modes dataset able demonstrate find median set data odd number values set data number able define trim mean weighted right whats measures central tendency im going explain im going talk biggies mode median im going talk end lecture im going special called trimmed second weighted lets central tendency thing think quantitative data quantitative data qualitative think having pile numbers like things want know tend course dont know center start looking data kind high hundreds like systolic blood point quiz classes numbers low like question group center list data theyre dont sort sensory distributions slide youll left youd probably looks sensory whats right know normal distribution left skewed right distribution intuitively kind know im lecture going actually numbers difference left numbers measures central tendency going mode median median little different depending odd number values number mean means thing calculate slightly mean lot know mean theres couple special called trim mean called weighted average weighted mean dont know chose word average mean average mean im going okay lets start mode number data set occurs little tiny data set obvious mode right repeats look changed theres want know lot data sets dont mode theres usually happens broad range numbers like systolic blood pressure mean kind lucky got people dont think theres going possible mode like ive got repeats repeat youve got modes right lets actually repeated times mode threes trump twos right imagine confusing gets got ton whats little confusing um like said broad range numbers kind coincidence patients exact systolic blood pressure platelet count know like course measure bunch people eventually youre probably wanted look slide numbers youd organize count mode probably lot wins thats repeated repeated kind worth lot work mode tell doesnt tell popular word mode french means like slide know allah mode thats popular common result lot ill oh class point quiz meaning everybody pretty popular remember learn words resistant like measure resistant cant whack change things pretty easily mode modes resistant demonstrated slides changing number erase mode add stable kinds things dont like healthcare dont ill cooler measures central heres cool called middle ill explain little bit mean center okay remember talking quantitative youve got pile numbers doesnt matter sort order lowest talking point quiz easy people somebody gets usually somebody doesnt quiz doesnt matter 100 people class numbers order lowest highest youll repeats data youll like said person maybe didnt quiz everybody gets gets easy quiz zero dont like said know data values like everybody gets quiz doesnt weirdnesses data arrange thats mean median number halfway halfway ive got 100 people class ive got zero left know fours fives know count 50 right probably going range thats mean youll values order theres repeats outliers order count thats median ill find median step order data smallest im giving dont know data mean data set starts 42 im going demonstrate odd set actually im going demonstrate version remember goes little differently odd number numbers number okay step order data smallest largest theyre im numbers theyre order smallest largest going rid numbers instead position lets look data set im going find median number positions know middle imagine seven data points wed wed circle thats odd values order middle number thats okay downstairs data set positions fourth position kind middle right literally average add happen seven like 10 average seven seven plus divided median odd number values youre going taking youre median number values like decimal youre looking values straddle middle youre going making kind wacky number like 5 thats underlying data um fine like numbers like 150 numbers mean order begin know like use excel probably know find middle little lets odd number im giving example like 21 love lets 21 students class thats wanted median grade id thats dont use end case id thats 41 41 plus 42 like dont know im picking ones like 27 27 plus 28 divided force number thats position 21 students class took grades raised order lowest lowest highest like quiz grades know probably wouldnt matter start lowest count 11th 111 position find middle number number took example 14 youll notice use use formula doesnt thats thats remember earlier slide fourth position average basically saying 5 seventh eighth straddles n like 100 nice 100 plus 101 youve got know 5 right secret message line data 50th row 51st row add divide thats going wanted share little formula case like large number numbers thrown putting order big figure count use formula middle median tell lot called 50th percentile data means 50 half data points median intuitively_makes sense created created half points known middle rank whats nice median doesnt care ends like gave extra credit people point quiz got sixes probably median wont change middle action find outliers dont bother like people zero quiz know theres 21 people 100 people isnt gonna affect know things happening like median resistant stable cant whack outliers throwing im moving measure central tendency mean threw trimmed mean weighted average kinds going talk little bit resistant measures like im gonna step talk little bit greek letter sigma thats actually capital sigma speak actually trouble speaking statistics lot try avoid lectures cant introduce capital english statistics ease guess wah like expect like sigma x sum x remember making looking modes value considered x okay values days sets sum x mean add add threw example lets somebody came said sum x y mean x ys lying somebody came said know prices food basket grocery store right somebody said youd like okay prices thats okay lot statistics going use want head theres probably going gonna batch numbers numbers data set called x numbers called theyre know means slide upper times new roman lower ones arial look kind wanted ready deal okay im hitting formula lot know calculate didnt know basically like fraction sum x add add youve probably actually thought id demonstrated um sum remember data points median kind copied got axes 40 40 divided mean probably wanted sort crosshatch actual okay im going little break talk means remember talked sample statistics population somebody talks mean look mean youre going tell going obvious sample mean population mean write x bar x line thats pronounced x bar youll write sides x bar hard little means thing x bar x bar x line means sample saw like x bar equals know mean secret code says mean comes sample x bar look right youll says theres m pronounced mu greek letter youll youll left right n times new roman looks little pronounced saw mu equal sex youd like whoa population probably dont mu lot like people usually dont measure population lot work x bar want cognizant says mute says x bar going mu theyre talking x bar theyre talking important talk samples use lowercase n mean number use talking populations use uppercase n capital youll sample mean formula left x bar equals sum x divided n changes youre talking population mean youre like come add like mu basically population mean capital number population means issue supposed label youre population mean mean youre supposed mu youre supposed use know write like right youre sample mean youre supposed x bar youre supposed like left wanted clear rest mu im gonna mean mean gonna x bar mean mean gonna mean alright weve talked measures central tendency wanted means medians kind cage match wanted look ive sort giving accolades median right resistant outliers remember pointed throw outliers doesnt unfortunately means resistant throw like took point quiz felt like barring student giving 10 points totally screw mean things weve_got outliers data use want use got different things try stable mean honest mean im going left slide high value low low value like outlier outlier throw problem want meal little resistant trim data outliers cut okay problem cant look data youre rule youre looking okay im going trim x x equal look away okay im people 5 trim mean means 5 data cut 5 basically lose 10 health care lot people mad dont want lose dont like use way fixing problem outliers use wanted simple way im going imagine 100 data points makes easier whats um 100 data points basically youd step probably mean didnt like saw data order like median order sort order know lowest highest 100 like circle ones theyre going cut youd circle theyre going cut youre youve got 90 values left thats 5 trim mean got tell people heres original mean heres 5 trimmed mean people idea outliers data got sort stable estimate im going trying mean stable trying mean little certain values mean count sounds esoteric way time great grade homework homework right homeworks worth 10 final grade doesnt 10 class like called statistics im going know teacher im going wait homework grade 10 final doesnt matter awesome homework grade bad going count 10 final thats weighted averages know dont think homework worth like 50 grade right doesnt want different things contribute different amounts weight final way messing mean making certain things going count kind bigger vote im gonna stick school examples mean example homework worth 10 final grade quizzes worth final worth want point ive actually seen people like cuz tutor like horrible making final worth like 50 shout like professors lets lets pretty good student got homework right gonna thats 0 lot schools lets got b plus quizzes maybe lectures werent good right got b plus quizzes translate number 5 point lets got thats bad thats thats bad probably want final counts greater weight right accounts 70 youd want wanted non weighted average like normal mean normal mean add 4 divide youd 5 b plus class right lets look lets look weighted average sum x times weights divided remember said sum x y like instead summing x like non weighted average x times w summit youre like whats w remember told homework worth 10 thats weight right percent weighted average use decimal youll weighted average im sum x w thing taking timesing point 10 b plus gets multiplied point thats 20 theres b got final right gets multiplied point thats sum x w thing dont bother divide w w case like add point seven plus point plus happens weights wanted let know reason goofy weights didnt add thing lower slide sum x w divided dont b plus class like thats difference non weight weighted average weighted average weighted final extra caused grade final grade thats want ive gone measures central tendencies wanted talk relate distributions learned example normal color coded way right theres color coded theres green theres purple technically point data normal distribution magic dont need histogram like use statistical software ill feed data like quantitative theyll tell mean median itll tell mean median dont look histogram says number mean median mode automatically know normal thats case skewed skewed distributions measures central tendency fact theyre different order depending right skewed left slide ive got example right skewed distribution right light alright whats happening mean getting dragged tail big blue mean right median sort hanging closer tail right tail pulling mode print mode lowest medians middle means highest looking histogram probably right lets look slide left skewed distribution know light left phenomenon going direction tail thats low end dragging notice median resistant doesnt course mode stays high data theres data right printout mean lowest medians middle highest im like okay look know left basically wanted tell distributions actual numbers sort conclusion lecture mainly measures central tendency right mode median mean know ive kind bagging mean im sorry mean resistance totally median want remember things yeah kind fix things trimmed mean dont like lose data find ways fixing fact mean maybe kind theyre outside showed weighted average know case hand calculate im actually student wrong upset thought getting bad getting bad grade didnt good job learning weighted average showed actually calculate grade turned b remember unweighted average crying showed weighted stopped crying getting dont try weighted average finally went distributions measures central tendency related distributions numbers measures central tendency distributions information right measures central tendency ready 2 measures hello welcome chapter monica library college im measures alright right learning end lecture student able state different measures variation statistics able explain calculate variance standard deviation ill hint right able calculate coefficient variation explain finally able state chebi shows going concentrating measures im going talk im going talk variance standard deviation different ones im going going coefficient variation abbreviated cv going talk chevy chevy chevy came theorem gonna_talk theorem leads calculate remember intervals like lower limit upper ill remind calculate championship intervals alright lets lets think variation mean means data vary imagine taught classes isnt hard teach classes teach classes different imagine gave mean grade said tell internally consistent grades instance lets gave point mean class know people got far like maybe class people got lot fives thats got maybe class everybody got like cant tell measure central tendency like median mean mode cant tell internally consistent data especially cant tell mean different classes mean totally different kind variation youre talking quantitative data data set measures central tendency like mean median mode doesnt tell story add information calculations going learn lecture ways express data vary data separate central central tendency central variation need know evaluate data started talking ways calculate measures um said im going im going talk variance standard want remind know im going sample statistics versus population starts playing formulas slightly different sample variance standard deviation population standard separate different finally going talk measures variation going talk coefficient variation cv okay going start range simplest youll notice right numbers dont okay demonstration range difference maximum minimum literally pretty easy calculate search highest maximum little data set got obvious somebody ate highest right sort obvious 21 calculate range highest minus lowest thats students actually highest minus tell thats im like yeah actually youll says 78 minus 21 equals thats telling ill thats fact problem working worked army army looked range ages soldiers range h alright obviously problem data right reason screwed record said somebody screwed record said somebody got 100 screwed data caused ridiculous range stable resistant right fixed know record said somebody got army normal range know like little like minimum 18 17 right slide picked minimum maximum change arbitrarily change suddenly wed totally different range measure variation stable actually kind doesnt weve_got range 57 dont know minimum like zero like negative like 105 know dont know place start thats measure going use statistics lot youll articles state ranges usually dont state actual number tell calculate actually state minimum thats variance standard thats live statistics measures youre probably wondering im talking theyre totally different theyre okay friends variance calculations kind big standard deviation square root thats theyre friends like trouble step square root standard actually talk formulas wanted set head words like remember worked mental health dont know didnt licensed leader said oh im applying state variance right meaning state allow vary thats variances data think spread data mean represent spread doesnt variance way representing data vary youre probably wondering standard deviation square root lets think word know standard means sort following variation standard data know word deviation means like oh person social deviant like guy healthy nose deviated know people deviated septum like crooked right trouble like sneezing blowing nose standard deviation simply mean everybodys variance calculation says things standard deviation square root variance want imagine head oh standard deviation means data deviates mean lot times students confused measures central tendency try apply variation variation totally different remember variance literally means standard deviation literally help formulas understand mentioned earlier formulas variance standard deviation different youre talking sample admittedly dont use population variance population standard deviation calculation dont measure tend use sample variance sample standard deviation im going youll notice conceptually theyre like um know population parameters like meuse like population standard deviations tend behave similarly formulas sample versions statistics want clear want use right symbol hinting analyzing sample versus analyzing population conceptually like means mean right want represent mean youre talking thats parameter thats statistic write formula im theres things want um theres different ways actually know like algebra big equation express thats formula way called defining formula formula rearranged algebra computational think thats kind funny computation right mean formulas results plugging numbers getting answer gonna use defining formula computational think funny computational formula like confused pretty ignore computational formula entire teach defining find students remember defining people computational formula tell im things hard way im going long know goes long way helps confused helps convince actually got right lets defining lets look defining formula look look computational formula defining lets minds remember told variance great calculate square root standard left slide abbreviate sample variance saying s standard deviation know sounds ridiculous right like dont special thing variance second sample standard deviation actually honest people use different im matches people var textbooks theyll statistical software theyll s second like maybe good way remembering standard deviation square root variance right s second remember s sample standard deviation s second sample ill population thats theyre lets look upstairs thing kind scary going work youre going know know theres little sign capital sigma know somethings gonna looks kind scary x minus x bar second thing handle n minus thats scary youll notice huge square root sign thats difference upstairs wanted picture calculator lot times havent math statistics forget concept square ill remind theres square root means times youll remember like 25 square root 25 25 calculator hit square root thing youll right times 24 youre gonna decimals right times youll want remind people forget havent statistics math havent right told talked numerator right numerator fraction im going talk sum x minus x bar squared know thats actually called little piece formula called sum sum squares literally mean half defining formula kind relax thing im going figure sum squares im going im going write later im gonna come formula figure equation sum squares okay lets look slide im left theres blank thats usually blank dont want column column talk know talking usually x column x minus x bar wrote minus use parentheses column x minus x bar second remember parentheses whats inside means literally x minus x bar second im walking ready going right slide im reminding sum x minus x squared second words sum going thats way saying sum easy way explain squares pulled data set imagine sample patients presented central happens doctor shell know time lab gives slip paper downstairs central lab slip paper okay sit draw imagining got blood asked long wait im central lab literally wait minutes thats good busy like lunch ill wait like 10 waited minutes couple waited minutes probably came lunch waited minutes 10 minutes 10 okay thats data little tiny data set wanted use small calculate variance standard deviation little data whats step making table blank table fill column called x actually patients waiting time remember sum x said sum x mean add xs right thats x column youll 2338 like identical little fancy sum x said okay thats sum step dont look left slide look fill column x words figure kind cheat figure remember formula mean x bar sample sum x divided remember told patients 36 hold number column column got calculate x bar hold youre holding realize going fill column x minus x bar means x x minus x bar helpful order xs like notice order 2338 1010 good idea helps brain think youre right lets minus x look column minus equals negative hate negative numbers okay negative deal slide minus water negatives youll notice 1x kind youre getting youre actually technically filling column showed equation youre putting negative negative second finally fourth minus got water 10 minus 410 minus order like thats fact thats happens end bunch negative ones beginning bunch positive later thats totally dont got careful got sure right ive people tests actually screw imagine train wreck happens sure means sure subtract single x right answer thats okay step got column remember square number dont like use x second button calculator negative times negative youll notice negative times negative pretty negative times negative know want look notice 16 thats remember said hate negative numbers lot statisticians feel fix squaring number racist remember negative times negative positive positive times positive thats little trick know comes squaring theyre called squares right weve_got 16 994 think add entire column sum look add entire column super complicated looking thing numerator variance equation right like wasnt okay turns number 70 sum sample variance im excited look okay got deal remember n right patients formula n formula going right lets kind running room filled 70 divided suddenly looks super easy right 70 divided okay thats totally easy right mean tedious right table add things guess gonna standard deviation youve probably guessed going square root remember button calculator 14 hit button 74 bunch stuff chopped sample standard promised talk population formulas standard deviation variance sample told wouldnt conceptually left slide sample variances expressed things red differences sample variances s second population variances greek remember told sum capital sigma like know greek like english sense capital lowercase letters thing think looks like jelly roll jelly roll looking thing actually lowercase im going lowercase sigma im going population variance population standard youll slide lowercase sigma population standard lowercase sigma second remember jelly roll thing talking population version standard deviation variance know mu versus x bar right x bar thats sample mean mu right population know n number theres big difference actually sample n minus population capital n think makes kind sense populations huge wont matter like know samples know adjust minus wouldnt matter like people mistake accidentally minus population dont different thats im concentrating sample thats wanted shout know arm formulas right slide know population level alright gonna range variance standard gonna_talk coefficient lot comparisons comparing different friends pathologist time actually use medicine comparing lab values assay different labs wanted explain time youve heard word gets little confusing people statistics new word coefficient actually kind generic term certain kinds youll hear somebody coefficient youll youll hear somebody coefficient word people havent means certain kind somebody says oh coefficient good high need ask coefficient talking words coefficient doesnt mean specific means number comes know coefficient theyre time maybe youve heard word im going talk time youve heard coefficient specific coefficient called coefficient youll textbook theres remember coefficient variation right way remember cv coefficients different abbreviations coefficient variation right slide formulas trouble formula right calculate standard deviation sample standard deviation population formulas calculate x bar mean sample pretty easy division like youll notice statistics certain things prefer certain things prefer like dont know like culture way coefficient expressed times percent thats pretty easy standard deviation youll patients took work right remember square root remember x needed remember earlier dumpster dive dumpster dove numbers calculation got students generally dont trouble getting problem like number mean right like mean divide standard deviation x bar times 100 like interpret percent easiest way talk actually thing youll notice statistics ratios things dont blood pressure like systolic blood pressure 130 divide diastolic blood pressure lab value temperature iq suddenly ratio doesnt units right doesnt mmhg bunch people ratios dont technically youll thats strategy statistics theyll ratios things dont know sort lacking power compare decided pull patients patients pretended went lab day gathered gather data came x bar standard little close right like x bar insanity visa sample patients s divided x bar times 100 equal 50 62 interpret cv measure spread data relative average sample standard deviation 50 second sample standard deviation second sample red 62 standard deviation compared means stable right got variance compared mean standard standard deviation compared moves said actually different labs know prefer lab purple lab know gonna like variation 62 means thats little hard happens different labs youre looking like maybe split blood sample bunch blood samples send half lab half youre supposed mean standard deviation right theyre blood dont like case youre comparing labs purple lab red lab produce predictable cv little hard easy thats awesome thing gonna chubby chef chubby chef figured long time started started thinking lets x bar s like noticed didnt notice cv noticed create lower upper limit subtracting ass adding s x remember making frequency tables said need class limits need lower class limit upper class use terminology lot like lower limits upper chevy like wait second got lets know force mean subtract standard deviation ill sort lower limit ill add standard deviation mean sort upper course lets pretend standard deviation like youd like totally symmetrically middle right x bar middle itd surrounded equally standard im saying standard deviation generically mu population standard deviation population sort like figured thats thing happen add subtract standard deviation example lets im gonna pretend population mu dont know measured got 100 population standard chevy thinking know 100 subtract 95 100 add started like working concept like subtract add like standard thought wait second standard deviations right like times thats 100 subtract 10 90 lower limit 100 add 110 upper range interval right lower limit upper limit interval sort conceptually realized rules useful interpretation limits right way uses limits going look figured able use know standard deviation mean multiples standard deviations mean actually come lower upper limits realized low lower upper limits mean percent data words percent axes lower upper percent depend standard deviations youre going right like obviously percent data covered limits theyre huge interval big covers expect percentage number standard deviations use working came formula figuring wanted work distributions like normal like uniform formula formula k stands number standard deviations number population standard deviations hes going use right lets pretend kb like standard deviations right youd says minus divided k second second divided minus point like point seven percent hes like okay thats im standard deviations upper lower limits 75 data axes going standard deviations way standard deviations way standard deviations students class think memorize minus k second dont story chevy chef memorize fun mean know chevy chef im showing proof right like youll answers chevy kind waste time youve plugged equation youll thing talking like imagine 100 right x bar standard deviation right times lower limit 90 upper able confidently 75 xs 90 id measured maybe 100 people right id 75 going fact 80 remember told predict number bigger know standard deviations going cover data right needed didnt come came 9 89 covered standard deviations right remind know upper lower limits interval right particular interval way chevy service interval everybodys happy work right wouldnt wanted demonstrate example championships interval know interpret okay remember patient sample theyre waiting room lab right waited average minutes standard deviation waiting right gave demonstration calculate standard deviation use patient sample patients sample purpose table defining formula huge finished im gonna ask pretend instead 100 patients right instead measured 100 got x bar 75 standard deviations okay measured 100 patients got want chubby shove rules standard deviations mean x bar limits interval know know studied 100 law 75 patients lower upper limits follow championship standard deviations 9 okay know doesnt sense like 9 patients saudia point theyre saying guess right yeah 89 patients words 89 patients course went wouldnt 8 patient 94 patients fit youre thinking start 100 patients isnt useful right youll left slide calculating intervals right lets standard deviations chubby chef interval negative 48 13 probably notice cant wait negative kind weird right saying 100 patients 75 75 championship interval weighted negative 48 minutes rounded zero zero minutes 13 48 limp minutes 75 fell 48 minutes kind happy guess 75 fell range means probably waiting widen interval like rounded 89 89 patients waited negative point minutes zero 22 widen interval going later 89 90 89 means wasnt bigger lets round 94 patients 100 patients 94 waited negative 96 minutes nonsensical starting patients zero 20 minutes dont know long kind happens line interval maybe certainty individuals happen sort better idea 100 patients interpret somebody waited lower upper limit 75 championship 9 patients know interpretation lower difficult concept lot ill home chevy shove interval works distribution normal reason thats home messages later going learn intervals work normal okay loosey works thats home messages chubby sets chevy says interval tell certain percent data later going learn intervals exactly certain data chevy shop little loosey goosey right championship intervals nonsensical negative time doesnt work youll high limits ultimately theyre theyre health literally heard chevy shows interval started teaching purpose teaching chevy says purpose teaching point statistics use s population standard deviation know standard add subtract add subtract mean good way making lower upper limits special thats main home message youll pattern class mean populations sample x bar know x bar population standard deviation right sample standard deviation added subtracted intervals certain taught chevy chef learn intervals later conclusion learn learned calculate range learned calculate variance standard learned calculate coefficient variation talked difference formulas sample versus learned chevy chevy theorem figured calculate intervals thought id picture chevy hes russian stamp ussr iron curtain thought knew figured good job youve measures youre ready quiz homework right youre totally good welcome chapter 3 percentiles box whisker monica library college going youre going end lecture students able explain percentile means describe interquartile range explain steps making box whisker plot state box whisker plot helps person evaluate distribution lets know talk box whisker plot think cute little animal ill explain whiskers mean animal box whisker plot going going percentiles going going talk core tiles sounds little slimmer got tiles youll youll understand theyre going compute core finally going box whisker percentiles going flashback youre going like little going remind standardized maybe subjected gone high probably got deal standardized remember talking quantitative standardized test non standardized test usually points thats quantitative remember standardized tests id know showing friends got right theyd send thing learned pretty early mattered pool people maybe taking test youre taking test lot stupid people easier higher percentile percentile means example test 77th percentile means better 77 people taking lot standardized tests didnt care points got cared different batches people different got lot lucky got lot stupid people score didnt matter absolute score mattered sort remind somebody come high school said got 77 percentile id okay 100 people taken test youd better sunday course brady brady know like 95th 97th happened wondered realized people pool know public high school minnesota pulling public high schools minnesota ninth grade know pulled 10th youre taking like nursing examinations theyll theyll try tell people know strategize try stupid people taking course makes tell stupid people taking right dont know whos thats thats percentile percentage people better youre 77th percentile better okay heres rules know gave example 77th percentile rule like cant negative second percentile 100 fifth thats number pick like saying percent values fall 100 minus number values fall like 20 people test 20 right lets theres maximum score 25th percentile means 25 scores fall score 75 fall lets easy lets 20 people 12 total right remaining everybody gets know 25th percentile score cuts tests right easy know 12 people got 50th percentile technically right come differently hard test people got score right percentiles shifted tell mind difference actual score percentile happens mean percent people got score lower score doesnt actually score right thats want remember going okay going talk core tiles interquartile remember tile think relates little core tiles specific set youll little theres technically core tiles quartile doesnt count like remember 99 like calculate second 25th percentile quartile 50th percentile known median youre good right thats known second quartile 75th courthouse 25th 50th technically right goes quartile 25th percentile second quartile 50th quartile 75th actually hard calculate heres like sort order data smallest largest remember quantitative data sort sort smallest feeling immediately right guess thats step find median median second quartile 50th know right harder step find median lower half median pretend thats end look smaller values find quartile 75th finally step probably guessed find look upper half data median maximum median data thats 75th okay ill overview remember range range yeah remember thats maximum minus minimum right told actually equation tell thats new lecture inter quartile okay know quartiles inter quartile sort means like quartile quartile calculate inter quartile range rqr iq remember thats interquartile thats quartile minus ill okay heres example right slide sample data collected went hd comm thats american hospital directory calm provides publicly available information american went took random sample 11 massachusetts hospitals theres lot took random wrote beds hospital 100 beds theyre considered kind big 100 beds theyre considered smaller wrote step making courthouse order data smallest youll right slide smallest hospital 41 beds largest hospital 364 beds order theyre lets step find median thats quartile 50th youre good 11 know sixth row going median know odd number hospitals sixth circle thats 50th percentile median got quartile funny start quartile color kind remember whats going 126 thats kind anybodys lowest orange ones considered blue ones considered color coded track whats going okay going 25th percentile goal find median lower half color coded pretending orange ones finding counting 126 find 90 25th percentile remember 75th low like 25 low 75 higher lower data find median thats going 25th case thats 90 probably guessed blue ones right upper half course thats 75th calculated 50th percentile 25th percentile 75th thats meant overview course shout iq r interquartile remember thats 75th percentile minus 25th case thats going 254 minus 90 equals iq gave test asked iq data cant 254 minus 90 actually work thats quarterly wanted step philosophical points happens q1 q3 depending data okay remember step order smallest lets pretend drawn values slide position number example lets going median know id id 90 plus 97 question q1 q3 given example having values 90 97 mushed median dont reused reused looking half went q actually count fact q 74 thats median numbers median right q actually 121 actually count words like values median mushing values like taking average values values double dip line gets gets calculating q1 seven values instead okay expanded pretended seven youll seven little like 11 values median clearly case 97 youll notice q middle number ones q middle number thats happens seven happens 11 values like demonstrated super values suddenly gets little 41 97 121 median wed mean 97 remember dont 97 gets double dip calculation q1 121 gets double dip b calculation double dipping youll numbers contend course q1 actually mush average 74 upper data order q youre going average 126 142 ones position position youre unlucky like values realize youre going median making average numbers q1 making average numbers q3 super predictable whats going pay lot remember median numbers average numbers double dip downstairs upstairs calculating q1 instead median number like odd number values guy stay double dip q1 q3 values right remember 11 values like having seven median clear like um medians data day know odd easy case median fifth value thats 121 double dip right calculate q values counting stuck taking average second value thing upstairs know 142 know middle numbers average guess long way saying got careful sure youve gotten median figure median kind median youre circling medium came average medium came average know numbers going double dip q1 medium odd number data like middle doesnt double okay double dipping im getting roller coaster im going double dip ice cream okay gonna box whisker plot kind like percentiles getting graphed lets ingredients created box plot fact thats trickily went portals weve created ingredients box sort summarize left slot slide 50 times hospital beds counting smallest regional hospital 41 q1 little order cure 90 median q2 know mean mean cuartel right like cues q3 maximum okay lets remember data looks like right okay im going walk box draw thing know draw usually draw line vertical line zero cheat look maximum oh maximum like maximum like know think massachusetts general hospital like 600 800 gotten maximum maybe 900 know little bit maximum 400 divided half like 200 kind divided 200 400 half kind eyeball draw way okay got thing going okay heres thing going draw q1 left slide youll circle thats right slide horizontal line look proportion upward graph thing know numbers probably dont want wide dont want right like goldilocks okay horizontal line copy line parallel look youre hope youre lost look know 100 200 300 400 know q1 90 10 thats knew position 254 thats know little bit higher halfway 203 thats roughly knew statistical software demonstration purposes thats okay weve q1 q3 horizontal lines alright heres connect box box gets right alright little circle right slide wanted sure saw whats thats q2 median right median little bit q q connected box think easiest order youre drawing hand youre statistical software way know box median fits looks got youre probably wondering time whisker thing figured boxes whiskers markers minimum youll minimums whisker called whisker dont know called whisker different guess thats reason notice like half size half theyre small want position like vertically middle like dont want youll notice maximums way high draw probably guess yeah connect whiskers good went box lets look inter quartile remember calculated took q minus q means boxy thing beds long right thats visual pictorial boxplot inter quartile youre probably wondering dont ill main things look distribution know know guys learn histogram youre good stem ways looking histogram data youll find mean know pile data histogram stem leaf youll find images agree youre probably thinking agree look right slide im giving skewed right skewed right data knew histogram saw skewed right distribution took data boxplot kind like skewed right whisker high thing connecting whisker like long skewed left opposite right long normal distribution remember thats thats mound shaped distribution larger words bigger standard deviation bigger variance right youre going box thats big smaller spread normal distribution youre going box looks youre probably wondering getting shapes ill kind slide wrap fly roller coaster like roller coaster roller coaster skewed right sense right want steeply boxplot roller coaster youve got sort start going thats kind near median kind near 25th start youre getting slowly thats like long tail good guess design roller coasters long tail right skew thats mean mind youre going getting histogram box kind im im saying flew histogram roller coaster like shape box conclusion talked percentiles general like 77th percentile focus quartiles specific set going calculate reason needed order interquartile finally need quartiles order interpret box whisker okay isnt roller coaster im going im going guarantee skewed greetings hi monica wahi library college lecturer bringing chapter 1 scatter diagrams linear heres youre gonna learn end lecture able explain scattergram state strength direction mean respect correlations compute correlation coefficient computational finally able describe correlation necessarily lets jump going talk making scatter thing right screen scatter diagram kind kind going talk correlation coefficient finally gonna shout causation lurking variables remember talked going talk lets start scatter plot like statistics theres got scatter gram scatterplot mean lets scatter grams scatter plots graphs x y whats xy pair xy pairs measurements measurements individual measure height weight thats xy pair measure height friends weight thats xy pair thats different people right xy pairs x called explanatory independent graphed x remember algebra graphs vertical line y axis horizontal line x trouble remembering whichever x whichever pairs x expect graphed x called explanatory remember theres got million names explanatory independent talk said heres xy pair independent variable explanatory variable need like secretly know im talking surprise heres y y called response called dependent graphed y like said trouble remembering vertical y axis remembered capital y grab tail pull straight youll thats remember thats y axis doesnt hurt stretch ys tail vertical remember thats y x okay find way remember means like x mean explanatory independent mean response know sing abcs fast n w x y z right x comes y know alphabet x arrow imagined head saying x causes y doesnt necessarily cause ys youll end lecture think happens y dependent x x independent wants y thats way remembering x independent variable y dependent thats long way saying scattergram graph xy thats going needed xy pairs right asked question number diagnoses patient correlate number medications takes dont diagnoses probably arent meds lot diagnoses lot know people real life sort violate depending mean bad diagnosis lot bunch diagnoses taken care mad perfect kind reasonable thing x y paris im got pretend heres patient person x sub diagnosis like saying bad diagnosis person y right thats read lets start making scattergram labeled x axis number diagnoses right things straight y axis number medications youll dot right x went number diagnosis right diagnosis went right goes dot thats person gets dot thats youre going ones okay threw dots kind heres second person right person green arrows going theyre scatterplot like like cheating know practicing right person x y dot goes fourth im sorry goes scattergram course lot times like hundreds showed simple okay talk linear correlation youll kind linear correlation term means scatterplot xy pairs kind looks like right like thats like thats like algebra right algebra youd perfect lines dot right line x notice theres thats algebra perfect linear looks like graphing points actually scatterplot like people xy pairs suspect theres wrong actually happened statisticians came said monica look wont said dont graphing said x axis weight persons y axis weight im like weigh peoples livers like sounds goes oh learned dont waste peoples livers use equation estimate weight liver guess whats equation actual im like thats came like line y calculate like oh youre smart biology suspect somethings fishy things dont end right close close perfect linear wanted let know thats whats going linear okay lets talk facts linear things linearly correlated perfectly line obviously little thing dots scattergram imagine line going imagine line going like kind looks like going called positive dont line want x axis number patient patients madder theyre grouchy gross youre making y axis number nurses staffed shift right theres sure got lot nurses dont patient complaints right theyre people inverse presentation im calling negative goes goes goes thats depicted visually line going imagine line going thats negative better know positive versus negative explains things behaving x y situations theres correlation like x y youve seen know youre patients hospital big families families come dont loved x totally unique visitors meaning count person theres patient unique look spent hospital person thats seven days visitor keeps coming maybe patient second unique persons day people people like person unique theyve hospital days probably people doesnt matter long persons hospital theyve got lot loved ones coming theyll right right according end imagining straight thats correlation thats better worse scattergram try understand x y like books sort goofy dont know goofy picture like books know lobby number games lobby number books way goofy like dont alright weve talking actually far weve talked direction talked positive negative youre talking correlation thing going talk figure strength refers close line dots fall close line considered fall kind close line called close line remember thats totally different direction positive strong negative strong right positive moderate negative statement strength statement close dots scattergram file close line end thought id strong negative look notice pink dots strong dots right know itd perfect strong strong refers fact dots correlation dots line fair kind going theyre kind far eyeballing gets mainly dots youll notice theres thats like right x hey look like title theres like thats like outliers whack weak correlation line looks like powerful basically connecting got careful thats scattergram large powerful effect especially corners like weird outlier kinda middle going upper right upper left lower right lower affect direction like like know like seesaw teeter totter know outlier change mess strong weak thats want start thats way chapter organized starts want look x y look going correlation coefficient r going computation actually making use watery terms like direction know positive negative moderate strong weak explain actually number correlated x remember word coefficient coefficient variation cv know kind going talk different time coefficient time called coefficient means number like use kind weird like im talking correlation people like isnt like correlation like dont know didnt remember correlation correlation coefficient remember r means technically mean sample correlation population correlation coefficient right like know imagine youre correlating like height weight population like oh everybody particular state actually need greek showed screen dont know fancy p dont know dont actually cover want going focus r sample correlation r like said numerical quantification correlated set x y actually calculated plugging xy pairs equation hand lot xy pairs tried like remember standard deviation variance like defining formula computational time im going computational formula opinion ways gets thats going going set xy pairs going calculate interpret let prepare mentally going calculation produces number lowest number possible negative thats perfect negative like algebra line going dots r negative right want think like negative correlation r thats like negative point close negative 0 close negative close perfect negative thats want opposite highest possible number mistake perfect positive calculate r gets close like point like said youre thinking whoa close perfect positive correlation like know point negative point point 02 negative point oh like negative 0 thats lets calculate okay wrong right calculate r negative like thats right got negative 0 scattergram know negative positive calibrate expect kind big im going pictorial remember single time right um thought know helpful real life examples real life examples okay real life dont right im started negative hours im feeling negative went literature found article oh mit evolutionary principles modular gene regulation nice know im supposed cut eating thats nice scatter calculated little thought look thats labeled d dots right looks kind like moderate strong negative correlation right dots kind close group calculated got negative point kind makes sense opinion lower right arent official cut points usually use guide said negative point negative point seven lets look dots dont cluster close line d thats going weaker correlation negative right negative look little opinion moderate low look af like way far away line theyre weaker correlation negative point thats examples ill promise positive heres positive rs didnt draw line different article right says obesity associated macrophage accumulation adipose try cut um look left youll x y pairs plotted dont line imagine expect imagine theyre clustering line r point mean high moderate world makes look right know b look connect dots thats tightly hugging surprised r thats pretty wanted tutorials actually went forth calculated r thats thing scatterplot expectation r look calculate r totally wacky know okay lets calculate lets use computational okay threw formula upper left dont feel overwhelmed going apart carefully want flashback chapter c sums capital sigma going handle calculating lot like handled calculation calculating variance standard going like table going fill columns going add columns good 2 youll story lot easier check work theres story pretend seven patients going clinic theyre good patients came clinic visit measured diastolic blood pressure predicted thought sense higher diastolic blood pressure appointments year probably theyre trying stabilize run sure maybe problems makes perfect sense right wanted right youre going diastolic blood pressure appointment x know think thats maybe explanatory variable know independent variable lot number appointments year youd okay hi dbp probably means thats idea maybe youre wrong um title reminder access number appointments dont look column patient number know exciting want track patient notice x patient appointment 70 mmhg patient 115 thats kind fake dont worried fill chart look appointments year patient went patient like 45 believe theyre coming time stuff know patient 21 patient xy pairs patients pretty simple sum columns xs 678 ys im reminding calculation upper want attention terms sum x know making table wanted point saw sum x exactly sum sum x y right thats x thats x thats later game gonna sum x y term thats x thats x okay downstairs sum x second right looks awful lot like left says sum x second right tell difference kind parentheses kind rule regardless whats going whats thats parentheses got parentheses version know sum x second parentheses sum x sum x e right dont dont know sum x squared calm thats x times x x times x x times x line thats matter statistics symbol x squared look theyre theyre know dont thing sum x squared look column x second column hope right theres ive_shown equation sum x sum im showing term happened filled x second patient 170 times 70 thats getting patient 115 times 115 thats goes ill bet guess y dont confused kinda skip thats y squared im 45 times 45 sum look equation thats sum y x reminds shes like monica dont know x y x y mean mean pretty x times y like 70 times goes x times y wheres times like know supposed times like dont right dont like theres like like know ill tell guess imagine like little multiplication symbol x thats whats thats youre supposed imagine guess looking like youre right guess youre supposed x times patient took 115 times thats got lot sum whoo thats big circled think figured obviously n seven right seven patients bunch think lets rewrite exact equation ingredients like said n n youll sum x y goes x y downstairs youll filled let talk little bit levels numerator denominator numerator order operation need end times sum x y thats seven times 18458 need know 678 times 166 youre things subtract second thats order numerator denominator little bit little left seven times 678 squared square root thats seven times 166 times term youre square root things thats lot work right wanted probably want work term separately work terms like thing telling x y terms work square root left square root right multiply slide help threw numerator relatively different numbers left denominator right denominator check course multiply number ultimately calculation comes youre trying calculate numerator youre trying calculate end divide numerator denominator answer heres got got positive know positive remember probably everyones opinion run point thats getting close people agree thats pretty diagnose correlation positive okay want wrap giving facts r requires data bi variate normal distribution didnt check r class dont know statistics class bring talk checking normal know things dont units remember coefficient variation didnt units things dont units talk perfect linear correlation r equals negative thats negative correlation r equals 0 positive mentioned linear correlation r equals probably wont real ill r r positive right regardless positive negative 00000 close means theres probably like linear learned positive negative art wanted remind behavior x y circumstances positive r means x goes y means x goes y negative r means x goes y means opposite x goes y goes travel opposite heres fact little factoid choose switch axes like lets designate xy pairs designate certain variable x certainly y actually designate opposite doesnt matter equation youll end r doesnt matter x x y know y x like switch youll end finally converted xy different units lets england correlation height metric system patients system wed different numbers cuz obviously convert finally subject lecture lurking variables youve main point want correlation dont want misled beware lurking remember lurking variables things lurking scenes caused things realized selecting x y like xy pairs designating x y kind political youre implying x cause lets youre correlating height weight taller people cause x height y know people dont oh im short gain weight grow know thats way things x height y reality causes weight fact things cause height weight like genetics right genetic profile leads thomas obesity lurking variable relationship height tall people obese theyre genetics programmed tall obese right heres example got real um theres claim eating ice cream causes murders noticed areas ice cream sales murder rates dont know good ice cream makes im mean happened right reality summer warm weather lurking variables sell ice cream know ice cream consumption people outside murders know minnesota gets cold periods winter oh gosh totally murders like people dont commit murders frigid thats situation theres lurking dont want start know screwing ice cream laws making ice cream misappropriate ice cream causes murders right theres lurking variable thats professor biostatistics class use c like time series chart long time like pointed people purchase onions overtime onion consumption stock market rises right stock market slow people arent eating true um yeah weve problems economy think start eating bunch onions right healthy economy lurking healthy economy people buy food including onions healthy economy boost stock got careful correlation know want stock market dont everybody definitely dont stop eating ice cream end day youre going able affect murder rate bringing ice cream consumption youre going able fix stock market making people eat thats concept lurking correlation necessarily conclusion youre correlations scattergram want idea visual idea strength want look outliers calculate hand careful big hairy dont want finally interpret careful lurking remember correlation necessarily time ice hello monica wahi library college lecturer ruin day chapter 2 linear regression coefficient end probably painstaking lecture student able explain squares identify describe components squares line equation explain calculate residuals calculate interpret coefficient determination cd alright cool crystal ball predictions right look crystal nice equipment ive friends theyre nice dining room table unfortunately dont play statistical im going lecture use statistics prediction instead beautiful crystal going start talking squares going talk squares line equation crystal ball thing use statistics going talk dealing prediction squares finally going talk coefficient lets lets started term criterion right remember criteria plural criterion means criteria stuff need meet right eligible like meet criteria registration college right squares cartier tyrian awesome meet things probably wondered watching lecture know exactly draw line like know line chapter plotted scatter grams drew line actually official rule line basically rule meet squares okay meets criteria theres line line roughly looks draw line vertical distance dots slide dots theyre word square indicates youre going going negative square negative youre going square okay imagine going try like maybe draw line calculate squares youd like okay thats maybe tilt line calculate goal add added squares line belongs causes smallest sum squares data software youre youre person right software youd figuring software brain exactly tilt line exactly minimize squares im going explain trick figure line close draw scatterplot challenge knowing exactly belongs youre probably realizing dont graph like maybe need talk somebody line goes cant draw explain line goes use remember thought id little quick review lines equations okay going squares line im going little flashback algebra im sorry painful um hard wasnt good um isnt statistics algebra wanted algebra chapter given xy pairs different statistics lined line pink dots perfectly line okay xy remember graph kind like scatter given equation y equals b x plus right linear equation describe like okay dont equation teacher b stands slope line right know slope mean line tilted know slope know algebra slope calculate rise run know algebra rise run youd youd like youll needed thing order define imagine line elevator slope right need anchor y h stands y interceptor spears y drawing looks like zero comma zero right dont look algebra youd filled b grab xy pair plug x plug y plug b calculate y intercept thats linear thats wanted remind similar things statistics little wanted remind connect line looks like equation welcome statistics looks pink things want line know squares youre trying line minimizes squares um remember hello talking linear equation notice main difference hat right y wearing thats universally statistics letter number wearing hat means okay course estimating look line dots actually falls dont expect estimate fall line close right know squares way goal algebra use okay um like said software approach feed xy pairs software actually prints b prints slope y intercept love dont use class manual approach im making okay plug xy pairs equation slope promise wont ton xy pairs know youll step didnt going xs calculate x bar ys calculate y remember thats mean xs mean youre probably wondering case didnt notice dots didnt fall squares line fell line help calculate wider rule squares line rules x bar comma y bar squares know calculate thats actually squares finally x bar y bar plug b plug x bar x plug y bar y hat similar different process moral story need recycle right got good happened wouldnt point life making squares line hadnt started making deciding wanted r end big table remember end calculations like x y x squared x want recycle want save calculations fit equation want want save youre going recycle coefficient determination ill explain recycling youll actually new need calculate x bar y needed yeah old r calculations x bar y bar youll ready squares line alright heres remember big table remember story seven patients right x diastolic blood pressure visit number appointments thought diastolic blood pressure know goes maybe need appointments marker dont little okay right formula formula b tax gives formulas ive got favorite table right heres formula calculate b youll notice formula b formula got b lot times students little confused goal goal look slide goal come b thats squares line squares line equation going y thats thats variable gets going equals b going mushed x gonna plus trick turns negative ends minus thats generic goal calculate b squares line oh remember saying actually need new calculations need y bar need x little easier ive got column look slide remember x d remember n remember sum x divided n x goes y right sum y divided seven wanted quickly remind need generate things actually completely finish squares line summarized like cut chase basically summarize actual numbers youre going dont look big table alright youll notice grayed sum y squared realized later dont okay lets look left big list youll b equation filled right compare formula right youll whats going know n seven right seven thats n okay equation remember x y lets yeah thats big number 18458 wanted clear left seven times 18458 right sum x times sum y 678 times subtract right left order okay thats lets look downstairs n know thats seven sum x remember doesnt parentheses sum x square parentheses youd taking like 678 squaring doesnt use big numbers like upstairs got equation right term youve got multiply looking rest equation right denominator x squared thats exactly example giving 678 times subtract second remember order right c left slide numerator denominator divide thats b got worry wrote b b use b try figure remember look remember x bar y bar going calculate putting y bar minus remember order operation got b 1 times x subtract remember remember saying negative got negative alright got b got oh want check work work like able b times x bar right 1 times 9 minus know works know remember goal goal actually fill squares line look right y hat equals 1 b x variables x minus came plain 80 plus ad right beginning presentation teased going prediction squares line werent going use crystal going use finally exciting theres big warm rules right want realize draw squares unlike algebra xy pairs probably arent right like example xy need sure xy pair thats actually going land squares sure going land squares line x bar comma y reflect thats calculate right use x bar y bar calculation calculate y lucky data set x y pair happens fall squares line maybe couple cant need trust theres point squares line know going x bar comma y want focus succinctly slope b remember example calculated b got thats want point slope b squares lines tells units response variable y expected change unit change explanatory variable thats little kind tongue think example little easier fact slope 1 example having xp number appointments year essentially saying increase mmhg dbp x increasing 1 increase number appointments patient past dbp goes appointments goes dont know 110 appointment im saying y number units change y unit change x called marginal change sort think thats 1 1 marginal change y unit change want recall concept influential points right like point outlier remember got point need need sums xs sums ys sums sums like ar point outlier scatterplot drastically influenced squares line equation like screw extremely high x extremely low know pointing culprit check scattergram outliers end situation youre making squares line theres bunch outliers know okay im gonna bring youre probably like prediction im like relax issues right know word residual like kind sounds like residue right like said know somebody comes sits cup coffee table coaster leaves residue mad okay thats kind like kind like residue like left equation squares line equation theres want x remember seven patients x theoretically x plug equation y hat right want equation upper patient took patient ones x plugged 70 times 1_minus know equation got thats real screen know answer right patient patient 1 times 115 thats x minus know thats rest got 5 little closer look patient twos 45 close 5 thats little bit reason wanted tell residual y minus y case y hat negative patient minus negative got sick thats residual kind like residue right like residue leftover y hat y patient took y 45 minus y hat bigger got negative thats calculate line dont want big residuals right mean line didnt youll find good fitting line small youre probably like whats good fitting line coefficient determination thatll help constitutes good fitting prediction youre squares line equation want use lets knew someones dvp wanted predict appointments youre youre youre reusing xs data residuals youre actually imagining new youre gonna use equation plug dvp x y hat thats prediction right gotta use use x range original equation xs range original equation like 70 right know areas covered x right pick x type prediction called people feel pretty use x outside range like thats smaller like 65 thats bigger like 130 called good idea dont know going work im going example patient study dbp okay 80s right lets use looks familiar residuals new 1 times 80 minus 80 predict patient come appointments thats use squares line equation like crystal ball predict right easy right predict future cant linear equation old xy remember lecture looks like cloud thats doesnt linear equation know doesnt look like know feed stuff software feed stuff b formula youre formula youll youll line theres linear line scatterplot looks like good line right wouldnt work prediction right looks pretty reason cant accept line evaluate squares line equation interpretation need coefficient coefficient remember said recycle recycle recycle time coefficient determination called r literally means r times like remember coefficient remember turn r squared percent right times example remember early lecture r scatterplot showed dbp appointments right got r strong positive correlation right got want calculate r squared coefficient determination point times point point oh got percent end 90 variation thats explained linear equation right thats know y varies right like appointments know different 90 variation explained course 100 minus 90 theres 10 unexplained theres variation explained variables actually stated know youre writing paper youd 90 variation number appointments explained know people like explain like doesnt mouth like talking theres statistics contrast complimentary 10 variation number appointments explained right explained happen nice cd coefficient know got nice low lets think cd better 50 random right higher youre test nobodys going cd like 60 good dont know youd real life use compare models 60 course im going good low know higher better low means probably need variables help x use explain variation okay summary wanted chapter realize started set quantitative x y thing scatterplot wanted look linear relationship x wanted look wed seen lot outliers linear relationship class learn forced scatterplot linear variation forward calculated correlation positive negative weak moderate thats find linear addition lecture calculated b come squares line wanted notice sign b match sign positive r youll positive slope negative negative slope numbers wont match wanted notice strong correlations high coefficient determination theyre negative correlations remember r times negative times negative positive right strong correlation like negative point point doesnt matter direction strong youre going high coefficient b thing use linear equation calculate residuals right like took xs original data got y hat calculated use r calculate coefficient determination cd decide wanted use literate equation bad werent decided good prediction decided journey xy pairs way coefficient good conclusion squares criterion calculating squares line thing went reviewed issues prediction squares line looks kind looks kind know better sliced bread things finally went coefficient determination figure good squares line wanted point cd kind looks like cds know like pretty rainbowy cd means coefficient hello welcome monica wahi labarre college lecturer youve chapter seven broke chapter seven bite sized going start chapter 1 talking normal distribution empirical learning objectives end lecture able state properties normal curve state differences chebyshev intervals empirical rule explain apply empirical rule normal remember distributions learned ill remind little going talk properties normal distribution specifically normal curve shape comes making histogram normally distributed data going remember chevy chevy intervals going talk chevy chevy chevy chevy gonna empirical rule works_better chevy chevy intervals normally distributed im going example apply empirical rule normally distributed remember normal distribution fact remember distributions right distribution lot people sort forget time chapter seven wanted remind earlier lecture quantitative variable far patients determined classes frequency frequency histogram shape distribution shape skewed right light right okay thats example apply empirical rule empirical rule applies normally distributed heres undergraduate costume design university minnesota chemistry class big lecture large class probably 100 given difficult test 100 point test getting test t handing tests grade professor writing board reading frequency different remember ta handed test said im getting like 90s remember stating loud saying 73 awful score cant believe talking time professor writing frequencies realized score score thats hard thats nice shut noticed everybody giving dirty looks scored wanted imagine imagined normal distribution look like class distribution reason thought normal badly got imagined imagined class 100 people course test got 100 mode mean near great remember normal distribution mode median pretty im going use example fake chemistry test scores exhibit exemplify properties normal theres im going curve bell shaped highest point drew scribbly little curve little arrow thats mean wanted notice curve symmetrical vertical line theres like mirror image perfect roughly know true skewed bi modal things weve okay property curve approaches horizontal axis dont memorize remember asym totw asymptomatically close thats line gets close line thats bollywood thing way uh curve approaches horizontal axis touches crosses theres inflection transition points cupping upward transition points occur mean plus standard deviation mean minus standard little hard imagine youre roller coaster youre going normal theres youre mainly going kind level youre curve starts thats inflection youre going roller coaster youre flat start kind going thats second thats saying property curve inflection points roughly occur plus minus standard deviation finally area entire curve think nice square rectangle triangle geometry goofy shape right need head shape worth 0 proportion land 100 percent mean lets cut shape half 50 point lets cut different curve right line fourth curve 25 curve goofy shaped left thats trying think like yeah declare area curve equals reason declaring gonna cut different amounts percent empirical rule reviewed curve thing im going remember chevy shove im sorry know lets talk chevy chevy chevy shove helped intervals right intervals boundaries limits lower limit upper thats know bounds chebyshev intervals wed figure lower limit upper limit wed percent data falls interval right choose lower limit mu minus times standard deviation upper limit mu plus times standard deviation 75 data wanted demonstration fake remember 100 students class actually came mu test 73 better mean better mu class standard deviation calculated chubby shove championship interval 75 took 5 minus times got 5 pretty bad upper limit pretty good right 5 plus times 5 equals 100 point test thats pretty good grade right 100 data points 100 students 75 scored 5 youre probably realizing okay doesnt help monica scored wide range 75 people score probably guess knowing chubby ship intervals right didnt help narrow like class mu standard deviation calculated said okay im championships theorem left applies distribution dont need normal distribution use skewed youll notice like 75 data maybe 100 doesnt let start standard know start beginning 100 data falls youre saying useful kind gets stuck championships theorem applies distribution empirical rule applies normal youll lucky normal distribution want use empirical rule instead okay secondly empirical rule says approximately doesnt saying basically saying okay dont like unknown like maybe theres says says ill diagram says 68 data interview mu plus minus standard mu minus standard deviation way mu plus standard deviation 68 youll notice chevy chef didnt standard weve_got way useful apply empirical rule 95 data interval mu plus minus standard deviations 95 approximately bought chubby chef wed saying wed saying okay wed saying 75 empirical rule relatively sure 95 mu plus minus standard deviations like better right finally standard deviations youre kind running data 7 fall empirical rule going specific use normal lets okay diagram im going help actually thought diagrams saw pretty mind let unpack diagram theres lot want notice shape normal distribution want notice black line middle little arrow says want imagine mu matter actual like case 5 imagine mu standard deviation meal right youll notice sections thats colored little standard deviation symbol thats representing width standard standard deviation like mu plus plus minus like green mu plus standard itd mean plus draw parallel line arrow says mu plus zero course use symbols dont know big standard deviation mu plus standard deviation green area represents 34 youre lucky exactly 100 people like demonstration mean mu mu plus standard deviation test scores 34 peoples scores right yellow section thats mu minus standard deviation 34 scores youll blue thats standard deviations mu youll roller coasters lot lower ground section small 5 orange thats thats thats youll notice standard deviations theres little tiny piece right purple piece red piece worth 35 wanted point stuff end little black standard deviations theres point lot times people way sure youve got remember add percents slide youll 100 remember promised curve worth want notice theres kind cheat right add green blue purple little black end add percents youll 50 right thats half youll thing yellow orange red little add youll thats want conceptualize empirical roll empirical rule diagram left class frequency histogram right look meal standard section im going fill numbers okay fill numbers im going talk interpret lets start easy lets write mu underneath symbol wrote simple lets plus minus standard youll 5 mu minus times know demonstration times standard subtract meal wrote 51 underneath mu minus standard opposite way add 5 thats labeled kind guess going surprise going mu minus times standard deviation mu plus times standard deviation probably 5 minus standard deviations add standard deviations able mean remember n equals 100 mean means 34 scores 51 thats yellow right 34 scores 100 people im standing class ive got dont 34 people im looking score 51 know 34 34 class theres 100 score 5 73 right im getting idea 68 people 68 scores going 51 im right 68 im going fake test questions come lets question percent data student scores 5 80 think answer 5 lower limit orange ad upper limit add percents right 5 plus 34 plus 34 answer percent data 5 80 answer heres cut point marks 16 know youre area probably purple blue right 16 actually add point 5 little black 35 purple blue 5 youll cut point scores 80 constitute 16 heres quiz question percent scores 5 upper limit blue kind lets right add person scores remember said yellow orange red little black equals 50 wanted okay thats 50 plus green plus blue cut points middle 68 data wanted middle right youre gonna centered right middle 68 means 34 mean 34 cut points 51 okay im going ask similar question im going use different probability select student class student score 80 okay notice im totally different im saying probability actual answer probably guess add percents point giving quiz questions point percent probability mean thing im gonna percent data score 80 probability select student student scored 80 actually answer going use 50 answers 50 half curve plus 34 gets right probability select student student score 80 thats percent data 80 heres probability question probability select student score 5 51 thats asking question percent data 5 51 know answer thats orange right probability select student score 5 51 5 lets casino betting im like saying okay theres 100 students im going grab score im betting lot money im going grab somebody 5 youd probably like dont want 5 probability selecting probably want bet youre going bet yellow section green section higher thats think percent theyre kind wanted word questions means want sit think think happen different class taking hard test meaning nobodys getting 100 whats mu meaning everybodys standard deviation larger 5 intervals lets stare lets mu standard deviation like okay lot variation class mean ad right actually right standard deviation 30 actually mean thatd way bigger interval class chemistry undergraduate class costume bunch different kinds people thats probably kind big standard deviation mean reality probably big standard knew chemical engineering department chemistry classes chemical engineering majors ill tell standard deviation probably lot smaller probably alike got similar diverse class probably pretty big standard gets question standard deviation actually smaller like chemical engineering class taking chemistry smaller standard deviation maybe mean lets standard deviation like ad 51 wed way confidence knew scores fell like standing saying like oh know 73 pretty high everybody small standard deviation right high kind big standard thats reason want think thats shape goes mu standard deviation matters big standard deviation big areas different wanted remind percent area probability percents literally refer percent area shape okay imagine thing remind orange 5 area hole shape probability x like student x falls mu minus standard deviations mu minus standard select 1x group group im 5 probability x means conclusion empirical rule helps establish intervals apply normally distributed useful specific intervals certain percentage data refer probability selecting x intervals depend mean standard deviation data change exactly numbers intervals hope enjoyed explanation empirical practice good morning good good monica wahi library college lecturer moving chapter 2 3 z scores probabilities decided merge chapters thought actually kind belong didnt understand end lecture able explain convert x z score look z score z explain find probability x falling values normal distribution describe use z table look z corresponding percentage describe use formula calculate x z sounds like lot youll understand end lecture im going z score standard normal im going talk z score im going use z table answer harder questions ones talked z score probabilities section im going use slightly different formula calculate x finally im going remind tips tricks z scores probabilities talk z z score standard normal distribution lets look pretty recognize lecture little empirical rule remember empirical rule remember required normal distribution worked cut points available right like mu mu plus minus standard deviation mu plus minus standard ask questions right cut points good cut wanted notice empirical rule diagram numbers like circled like negative negative negative mew doesnt pretend theres theres okay standard normal called things right z green area zero z score thats lower limit z score upper limit green curve standard normal distribution right mean curve standard deviation c want notice concept im use know dollar things ive noticed lot countries theyll map currency maybe euro map currency dollar maybe egyptian pound map currency lot easier compare thats main reason standard normal distribution helps compare exes different distributions different normal distributions different means different standard helps map normal standard normal distribution standard lets talk z scores value normal x converted z score like saying convert currency dollars theres convert x normal distribution z know use formula right goes need x want convert z need pick need know mu distribution normal distribution standard deviation talking left formula calculating z right later remember lecture talking class 100 took hard test hard got 100 point got score um remember upper right theres meal meal 5 pretty bad score 100 point test standard deviation im going example calculating z score particular lets got friend smart friend thats friend got 90 face lets calculate z score 90 particular okay heres going going remind dont real life im demonstration purposes empirical rule stuff look remember mu plus standard deviation mu plus standard deviations know answer going 90 dont know exactly im showing demonstration purposes relate dont real life okay know z going calculate youll slide labeled z curve labeled z equals zero mu thats going anticipate going z score youll blue listed ingredients right smartphone score 90 mu standard deviation z okay x minus mu going 90 x minus divide look z score thats exactly x convert example friend friend actually got score kind low low meal 5 poor friend got lets try lets z score know demonstration remember empirical rule land 51 mu minus standard going expect negative negative z 50x going land calculate z calculate z score 50 minus 5 divided 5 negative reason negative left meal z score gonna exactly thought little bit left going thats little bit harder z score youre feeling pretty good z lets talk okay remember probability empirical rule old empirical rule remember gave question end lecture said probability select student score 5 51 remember answer like orange area z scores like 69 smart friend negative 07 smart friend know words excess 90 50 empirical rule figure percent probability thats step z scores okay lets ask question lets probability students scored ask im choosing ask words area curve z equals 69 like little ways blue wish knew area 69 z purple area little black wish knew know empirical rule whats cut points like dont know figure probability students scored nozzle smart friend right case diagram wed figure orange friend gets plus red plus little black percent proportion curve thats thats look z z table basically figured single z score negative ill negative 49 negative 49 positive went like figured single scores probability actually fit im going use table look way look probability happens empirical rule cut points youll empirical rule said empirical rule nice dont pull thats empirical rule cut points z use z table thing want figure area want right going start smart friend thats little bit easier actually okay probability students scored smart friend secret way saying area curve makes orange red little black areas left specified z value youre supposed use table im going use table look negative im going come tell mean use z book look appendix theres lot z tables theyre arranged little im remember z looking looking z negative remember said calculate different probabilities single z negative 49 positive 100th come fit z remember said negative 49 negative find z negative 49 imagine pretend z score negative 58 negative 10 right negative plain right id zero line little tiny fact lets look probability negative going negative negative seven column right whats song heres song left guess negative point known 14 point thats actually z thats probability thats percent youre case youre wondering arent negative page second page positive positive z scores way want hold head looked negative 07 point okay hold okay look green says areas left specified z value smart friend use table entry table point going use number found gonna probability kind makes logical sense knowing empirical im going example saying use example going look smart friends fact going ask probability students scored smart friend smart friend set z equals im going demonstrate areas right specified z value look table subtract result use opposite z case negative youll answer way second way im going demonstrate im going demonstrate happens look probability table subtract lets look z equals right z table time looking positive dont want want remember looking z equals looking thats thats going point hold thought point okay probability looked z remember supposed look table subtract thats found point 9545 table going minus point 0455 55 little tiny piece kind makes sense right distribution little piece blue purple little alright want imagine point 954 like 4 5 thats piece z equals thats blue green yellow orange red little black thats point okay looking area right specified z value showed way theres way thats use opposite going use opposite seat going look negative right z time looking negative negative 6 thing need find negative know im looks right oh okay hold know look table directly like 69 directly probability subtract got answer got right point oh 455 kind efficient use opposite z youre looking areas right specified z youre looking compare draw picture know dont mind normal curves drawn drawn homework wall guess maybe whiteboard thats probably best label z x know little piece z equals 69 95 thats tell little tiny pieces accidentally way forget subtract know maybe check normal curve drawing youll realize oh theres different ways find probability right z value try sure matter ways use finally reality check drawing sure got right piece theres theres big piece little piece skirt got 55 know thats little piece know drawing looking little thats reality okay thought werent harder questions harder little bit probabilities z heres question havent looking probability scores probability students score 50 90 middle note case actually axes label x x smart friend going x smarter friend going x xs step youre going calculate z im kind knew z national smartphone negative knew z smarter friend okay heres beginning strategy ill explain strategy ill z find probability left z find little piece remember direct probability z thats direct means copy directly z find probability right find little use methods finally imagine like curve youre subtracting piece z probability youre subtracting youre trimming pieces thats strategy basically find size probability little pieces sides subtract traps whatevers left ill remember z probability left z point use got answer find probability right z point o okay thats little piece got little minus piece minus piece total point 8122 point kind makes sense thats big piece wouldnt surprising 80 heres question havent handled looking probability 50 probability students score greater 50 right like like big okay actually normally areas right specified z value look table subtract result use opposite z case method wed end going minus point 1423 looked point 8577 use method wed z 7 negative 07 look z table point 85 point isnt actually harder question wanted works youre getting like bigger piece bigger 50 piece heres sort similar example looking probability students score 90 thats easy right areas left specified z value use table went looked z equals 69 got point thats 45 curve z equals 69 x equals mentioned ill mention youre supposed treat probabilities left z equals negative 49 p equals showed negative 49 looks like z like point theres actually calculate z like negative p zero second thing treat areas probabilities right z equals 49 sp equals imagine know 49 thats calculate z got like assume thats 100 okay um weve gone calculate weve talked looking probabilities z weve talked manipulating probabilities certain havent talked calculating x z youre actually given calculate x fact youre given probability use probability remember little percents middle table find middle table look z keys im going examples real life questions like homework task probably real real need calculate x need use formula red lets wondering score test score story distribution add z equals 5 okay z equals 5 asked lets curiosity wanted know test score student z equals 5 times 5 thats formula z times standard order id add mu x student got 3 student got score thats add z equals probably imagine people dont asking wonder persons score z equals negative dont usually phrase usually like question like score marks 7 scores thats secret way saying looking z p equals oh oh like turn 7 backwards actually looking z p equals oh oh im okay hunt okay lets start youll digging middle table right youll like point oh thats near ballpark looking point o oh lets scroll point o heres point okay getting oh thats point oh door point oh thats point oh want right point o point o oh technically closer point o point gonna choose point o probably probability record going choose going figure z gonna gonna map negative got way negative hold okay started looking z p equals closest got 0694 map z equals negative want notice negative 48 actually okay z score 7 going use positive version want 7 going use opposite going plug 48 times 5 standard deviation plus 5 equals seven score marks 7 im going time 3 scores kind challenging ill second imagine going hunt z p equals lets z right getting little good right digging middle looking okay starting oh heres point okay getting close point point point ask closer totally okay thats going use z z lets look c c negative look negative hold hunt p equals oh point oh didnt find p equals oh 301 table mapped z equals negative question want 3 id asked 3 wed lose negative use 88 equation want 3 going okay lets x equals parentheses negative 88 times 5 standard deviation plus mu score 2 score marks 3 scores happy okay heres challenging hard question tester probably real life test says scores mark middle 20 little arrows point middle mean hugging meal actually assuming theres gonna 10 right meal 10 left start figure z score minus point 20 divided equals right know minus point point point divided find z score point youre good z uh im know looked found point 4013 digging middle z table map negative z equals negative point lower limit z equals point positive version figured zs z left z right left use negative right use positive thats whats mark middle 20 data 9 weird 9 mark middle 20 didnt totally didnt worked right cant ill bet brain ready good time talk little help come little bit intense im going little z score quiz game style stuff right question youre test youre like oh gosh x wheres x cant find x usually usually way questions somebody like maybe mu standard deviation therell like maybe questions pertain mu standard deviation asked different teach class person know people come running middle test probably wheres x wheres x gave know pieces equation cant find id like walk look question know dont want away theyd run seats thats youre wondering panic wheres x look question usually okay lets find x x okay youre stuck x usually calculate z remember youve got x probably mu standard deviation calculate z youre panicking test x mean sandy nation fun calculate z score okay lets z score z score look right mean youre youre going direction youre getting started x z got z okay thats youre work calculate z youre like oh gosh whats step look z question asks x right remember use x theres x asking x use formula use x formula question gives p said p probability percentage like remember 7 3 percent start digging middle z table start digging looking start digging realize maps groove x formula youll probably final tips tricks getting z scores probabilities right ive said draw mean graph question draw curve draw line goes x goes mu start doesnt mainly want theres 1x shade curve wanted x x know idea want big thats greater 50 little thats 50 xs shade area wanted calculate x question z like 7 shade little 3 cheat little picture okay note x usually cant find x youre trying z formula youre saying okay im trying z thats im trying find thats asks looking question youll probably find big problem people mistake little zs obviously youve got z thats like negative know p cant negative probability cant wont like negative point right wont z bigger wont z equals 5 youre like obviously thats little bbc score thats zero like point o looks lot like p lot times people little lazy like hate z table calculate z score little dont dont youre calculating z need little baby z like finally remember step draw step step youre question check logic shaded big_picture probability bigger point shaded little tiny picture youre getting like point know thats check logic youre long lecture z gave introduction standard normal curve z score showed calculate z scores look showed end calculate x given z score okay want unfortunately students pretend students distribution got 100 okay thats case class lot times people 100 thats cant use grades okay good luck hello time monica wahi library college lecturer chapter 4 5 sampling distributions central limit end lecture able state new statistical notation parameters statistics measures type inference explain difference frequency distribution sampling distribution describe central limit theorem words formulas describe calculate standard heres introduction 4 felt like natural going review maybe overview parameters statistics inferences going talk ideas sort easy start talking sampling distribution new talk central limit finally ill little demonstration find probabilities x youre sure means dont worry able understand end right heres parameters statistics review overview remember long time ago statistic numerical measure describing parameter numerical measure describing population remember s s sample statistic p p population parameter probably okay different ways look measure like right statistic x bar x bar slide hard little line positioned im lazy x parameter new symbol pronounced meal looks like thing right um variants standard deviation remember theyre statistic version s variance s little exponent know standard deviation second variance square root variance standard thats s s second statistic parameter lowercase sigma thats second variance exponent regular parameter standard deviation youre_seeing im mentioned book proportion p hat parameter wanted little okay lets think word inference like infer like somebody implies maybe youll like implied hard came late inferred shouldnt come like know heard term theres smoke theres slide theres lot fire smoke coming fire look probably coming theres sort outside think like maybe know youve fire extinguisher phone maybe know maybe like youve dry eyes makes bunch maybe fire right theres smoke theres thats lets actually fire werent sure thought likely werent theres inference statistics use probability inferences cant smoke youre sure right theres different im going talk kind estimation estimate value parameter sample kind like smoke parameters fire estimate okay going talk second time type inference testing test help decision population words dont know want statistical going thats finally theres regression predictions forecasts statistic thats kind actually chapter reason bring estimation going chapter testing going chapter going chapter um know youd know lecture im going talk sampling distributions central limit need grasp things order things slide box estimation thats im okay going talking sampling distribution different frequency alright lets remind frequency distribution okay remember long time ago quantitative variable youd frequency use graph histogram example frequency histogram shows normal thats know step shape figure distribution quantitative variable x okay x like middle 30 xs okay going talk sampling distribution little sampling distribution start population thats thing youre dealing population pick n certain size like pick number youre going sample size samples size possible x bar theres ton samples right ill little wrap mind different going x histogram x like said im going kind im going imagine population going imagine going talk bmi body mass index wrap start population lets decide good right deal im trying samples n possible people heres sample took got x bar bmi lets try look double dipped okay x bar actually theres gonna ton right theres ton different mean end day theres groups population slide group going x write single x bars single histogram x course id start frequency look frequencies theyre thats ton samples youll histogram looks normally distributed frequencies high theres bunch different remember frequency histogram x frequencies x bar got thats sampling distribution ends looking like histogram histogram possible x bars possible samples end size picked uh fancy way official statistical way saying sampling distribution probability distribution sample statistic case x bar based possible simple random samples size thats makes sampling distribution frequency section youre probably like okay great thats section going talk central limit theorem comes theorem theres proof need understand concept sampling distribution inference order understand okay central limit theorem statistical im gonna start explaining words sampling words central limit theorem says normal distribution remember talking normal distribution sampling distribution meaning distributions x bars possible samples like talked normal distribution meaning skewed model looks kinda like important mean x bars actually student oh x bar x bars thats actually actually thing described dont try home youll night taking samples actually got samples population got x bars mean x bars youd mu check course easily taking mean entire population like easy way possible x bar particular sample size x bar x bars youll thats know sounds like thing inappropriate right heres standard deviation x mars actually population standard deviation divided square root words population data found standard deviation standard thing x bar took x bars found standard deviation x bars equal population standard deviation divided square root n use x bars sounds poufy theory thats central limit theorem heres people like look formula youll right slide little little formulas n means sample remember picked pick different right mu mean x distribution meaning population mean population standard deviation symbol standard deviation x distribution mean population standard look formula version mu x bars particular sample particular population going equal mean standard deviation x bars going equal population standard deviation divided square root n want point z weve z thing right weve imagine grabbing bunch xs words sample formula youre going x bar minus mu standard deviation divided square root n right thats kind moving happens sample youre looking x bar grab youre wanted point thing supposed happen n greater okay second thing wanted point piece underneath lower equation thats called standard error named reason like named piece separately usually piece number sitting know theres square root underneath standard deviation thing underneath thing hard usually standard error taking standard population standard deviation divided square root n number later use z thats things wanted brought okay heres central limit distribution x normal distribution x bar look thats example x thing samples x histogram youll pink bar distribution pictorial distribution x normal long theres 30 30 central limit theorem says x bar distribution approximately remember lot hospital data weve looking like hospital beds state youll skewed 30 hospitals pick n n n bigger bunch samples bunch x bar bunch possible x bar distribution hospital beds skewed x distribution x bar distribution thats important piece central limit thats important piece proof x bars end normal distribution underlying distribution long end youre picking greater finally leads know proofs build leads concept sample statistic considered unbiased unbiased right perfect mean sampling distribution equals parameter estimated words fact x bar x bar mu means x bar going mu exactly population biased representative right lets finding probabilities x want actually apply stop thinking theory okay lets remind right chapters 1 3 looking having normally distributed population quantitative values normally population mean mu population standard kept exercises finding probability selecting value population x population certain value x looking probabilities wed look z score z table basically converting m x z use formula convert x add x z distribution figure heres whats youll notice thing changed talking normally distributed xs talking population mu population standard grabbing population grabbing grabbing sample pick n going different time right grabbing sample boil number taking x bar mean value z score x bar instead x taking sample formula youll notice x x bar sample notice downstairs population standard deviation standard remember talked population standard deviation divided square root n thats n comes going matter z come right alright reminded explain lets n right x bar like grabbed n got x bar convert x bar z score formula course told population mean population standard deviation youll x bar youll youll z look probability z score z like chapter 2 x bar um thought walk youre kind good different 2 want walk little different sample versus okay remember poor chemistry class got 73 remember assuming 100 student 100 students class equals 100 class capital right theyre look slide youll mu scores pretty 5 100 point test population standard deviation population 100 student im going exercises lets going pick pick n bigger going pick n right im coming little pass class students 70 lets pretend question probability selecting sample 49 students x bar greater 70 notice ask question little bit whats probability getting set 49 students x bar greater 70 kind remind central limit theorem like n got different ends whats probability getting samples x bar greater 70 thats question drew remember old z distribution x distribution kind drew wanted point wanted point probability x bar going smaller x youre going lot work x bar im going remind equation equation im term assay standard like calculate separately like told end 49 right im population standard deviation thats number standard error lets calculate right heres z x x bar 70 minus 5 mu divided prep cooked standard error z tempted lets look heres z going little piece right thats little got look right lets going piece going use opposite theres remember everybody prefer way use opposite z youre looking going use negative 17 little piece right look im going demonstrate guys p equals look 17 youd big answer remember question probability selecting sample set 49 students x bar thats greater remember real test mean people mu pretty hard high probability pretty low point present version okay going try asking probability selecting sample x bar greater certain number going talk probability selecting sample x bar numbers right poor student class terrible chemistry test time decided choose end 36 youll notice choose perfect squares ends square root im okay heres question probability selecting sample 36 students x bar 60 drew picture remind thats gonna left meal know going dealing negative zs remember axes 2 situation 2x bars got x bar x demonstration know red arrows probability x bar smaller x harder group people x bar certain alright new formulas showed want emphasize making standard error help problems makes little easier calculate especially case going use standard error look exactly like standard error different n time standard error comes want remind bigger square root n gets mean n gets bigger square root n gets thats smaller standard error standard error small lot n heres z walk know x bar x bar 60 um whats going like told know x bars theyre kind negative weve_got negative remind right z negative thats little piece going want big piece z starts negative thats remember picture going deal probabilities right z looking left leave z thats p equals z got flip sign use opposite z going right probability check thats 50 point okay got like like time got minus pieces right probability thats probability drawing sample 36 students x bar 60 translate answer probability point rounded know like percents conclusion reviewed parameters statistics talked inferences talked sampling distribution thats different frequency tell know whats presented central limit theorem kind confusing know theorems theyre different principles different things central limit theorem permission operations finding probabilities x central limit theorem says know world use standard error kinds know addition finding probabilities x find probabilities got x dont feel
