00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.010
This lecture is a summary of this

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.570
course.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.850
This map shows the major topics we have

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.220
covered in this course.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230
And here are some key high level

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.610
takeaway messages.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.000
First we talked about the natural

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.670
language content analysis.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.220
Here the main takeaway message is natural

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.860
language processing is the foundation for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.170
text retrieval.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.010
But current NLP isn't robust

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.380
enough, so the bag of words

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.420
representation is generally the main

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.900
method used in modern search engines.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.990
And it's often sufficient for the most

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.890
of the search tasks, but obviously for

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.070
more complex such tasks than we need a

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.430
deeper natural language processing

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.300
techniques.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.370
And we then talked about the high level

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.405
strategies for text access and we

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:09.650
talked about the push vs pull. In pull,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.630
we talked about the querying versus

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.330
browsing.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.700
In general, in future search engines we

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.270
should integrate all these techniques

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.910
to provide multiple information access.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.350
And then we talked about a number of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.640
issues related to search engines

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.745
we talked about the search problem,

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:31.960
and we framed that as a ranking

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.560
problem.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.490
And we talked about a number of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.345
retrieval methods.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.683
We started with the overview of vector

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.020
space model and the probabilistic

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.628
model, and then we talked about the

00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:47.130
vector Space Model in depth.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.800
and we also later talked about the language

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.260
modeling approaches, and that's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.110
a probabilistic model and here

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.700
The main takeaway messages is that modern

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.510
retrieval functions tend to look

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.270
similar, and they generally use various

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.190
heuristics.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.620
Most important ones are TF-IDF

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.650
weighting, document length normalization,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.810
and TF is often transformed through

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.320
a sublinear

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.580
Transformation function.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.660
And then we talked about how to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.820
implement a retrieval system.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.047
And here the main techniques that we

00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:32.640
talked about are how to construct the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.690
inverted index so that we can prepare

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.490
the system to answer query quickly.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.180
And we talked about how to perform search

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.190
by using the inverted index.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.130
And we then talked about how to evaluate

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.750
the text retrieval system.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.440
Mainly introduced the Cranefield

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.740
evaluation methodology.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.105
This is a very important evaluation

00:02:57.105 --> 00:02:59.770
methodology that can be applied to many

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.540
tasks.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.685
We talked about the major evaluation

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:07.175
measures, so the most important

00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:12.690
measures for search engine--map(mean

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.860
average precision),Â  nDCG(normalized,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.585
discounted cumulative gain), an also

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:19.445
precision and recall are

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:20.990
the two basic measures.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.500
And we then talked about the feedback

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.970
techniques and we talked about the Rocchio

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.300
in the vector space model and the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.160
mixture model in the language modeling

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.900
approach.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.510
Feedback is a very important

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.460
technique, especially considering

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.025
the opportunity of learning from a lot

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.680
of clickthroughs on the web.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.990
We then talked about Web search, and

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.459
here we talked about how to use

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.940
parallel indexing to solve the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.360
scalability issue.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.524
In indexing we introduce the map reduce

00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:57.039
and then we talked about how to use

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.340
linking information on the web to

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.177
improve search.

00:03:59.177 --> 00:04:02.425
We talked about page rank and HITS as

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:05.132
the major algorithms to analyze links

00:04:05.132 --> 00:04:06.160
on the web.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.740
We then talked about learning to rank.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.850
This is the use of machine learning to

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.360
combine multiple features for improving

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.110
scoring not only the effectiveness can

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.336
be improved using this approach, but we

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:23.670
can also improve the robustness of the

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.850
ranking function so that it's not easy

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.300
to spam the search engine with just.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.680
Some features

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.930
to promote a page.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.448
And finally, we talked about the future

00:04:38.448 --> 00:04:39.660
of web search.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.300
We talked about some major directions

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.860
that we might see in the future in

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.540
improving the current generation of

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.400
search engines.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.420
And then finally we talked about the

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.710
recommender systems and these are

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.826
systems to implement the push mode and

00:04:57.826 --> 00:04:59.973
we talked about the two approaches.

00:04:59.973 --> 00:05:02.479
One is content based, one is

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.090
collaborative filtering and they can be

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.430
combined together.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.960
Now.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.930
An obvious missing piece in this

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.733
picture is the user, you can see, so user

00:05:17.733 --> 00:05:20.260
interface is also an important component

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.060
in any search engine, even though the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.950
current searching interface is relatively

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.275
simple, they actually have been a lot

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:29.390
of studies of user interface related

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.310
to visualization for example.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.310
And this is a topic that you can learn

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.179
more by reading this book.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.960
It's an excellent book about all kinds of

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.520
studies of search interface.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.980
If you want to know more about the

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.600
topics that we talked about, you can

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.150
also read some additional readings that

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.260
are listed here in this short course.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.160
We only managed to cover some basic

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.050
topics in text retrieval and search

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.670
engines.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.460
And these resources provide additional

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.110
information about the more advanced

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.170
topics, and they gave a more thorough

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.860
treatment of some of the topics that we

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.890
talked about and a main source is

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.730
synthesis digital library.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.870
Where you can see a lot of short

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.910
textbook or textbooks or long

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.272
tutorials, they tend to provide a lot

00:06:32.272 --> 00:06:35.040
of information to explain a topic and

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.630
there are multiple serieses that are

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.600
related to this course, and one is the information

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.680
concepts retrieval and services and

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.000
another is

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.950
Human language technology and yet

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.720
another is artificial intelligence and

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.685
machine learning.

00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:52.210
There were also some major journals

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.850
and conferences listed here that tend

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.520
to have a lot of research papers

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.200
related to the topic of this course,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.670
and finally, For more information about

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.480
resources, including readings and

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.040
toolkits, etc.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.310
You can check out this URL.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.843
So if you have not taken the text

00:07:13.843 --> 00:07:16.390
mining course in this data mining

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.680
specialization series, then naturally

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.655
the next step is to take that course as

00:07:23.655 --> 00:07:27.520
this picture shows to mine big text

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.680
data we generally need

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.400
two kinds of techniques, one is text

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.840
retrieval, which is covered in this

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.950
course and these techniques would help

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.050
us convert the raw big text data into

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.870
small relevant text data which are

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.760
actually needed in the specific

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.640
application.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.790
Human plays an important role in mining

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.889
any text data becausw text data is

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.820
written for humans to consume, so

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.645
involving humans in the process of data

00:07:57.645 --> 00:07:59.420
mining is very important.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.230
And in this course we have covered

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.970
various strategies to help users get

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.160
access to the most relevant data.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.110
These techniques are also essential in any

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.240
text mining system to help provide

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.619
provenance, stand to help users

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.720
interpret in the patterns that user would

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.910
find through text data mining.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.190
So in general the user would have to go

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.130
back to the original data to better

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.480
understand the patterns.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.453
So the text mining course, or rather

00:08:33.453 --> 00:08:36.560
text mining analytics course will be

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.390
dealing with what to do once the user

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.670
has found the information.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.340
So this is the second step in this

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.630
picture where we would convert the text

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.160
data into actionable knowledge.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.815
And this has to do with helping users

00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:54.310
to further digest the found

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.840
information or to find the patterns and

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.640
to reveal knowledge buried in text and

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.980
such knowledge can then be used in

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.250
application system to help decision

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.870
making or to help user finish a task.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.160
So if you have not taken that course,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.070
the natural step in the natural next

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.070
step would be to take that course.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.552
Thank you for taking this course.

00:09:25.552 --> 00:09:28.060
I hope you have found this course to be

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.690
useful to you and I look forward to

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.930
interacting with you at a future

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:34.510
opportunity.
