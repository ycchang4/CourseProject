00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.540
So we talked about page rank as a way

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.420
to.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.420


00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.100
Capture the authorities now we also

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.010
looked at the some other examples where

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.420
a hub might be interesting, so there is

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.440
another algorithm called hits and

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.615
that's going to compute the scores for

00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:28.070
authorities and hubs.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.730
Intuitions are pages that are wider.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.296
Sites are good authorities, then where

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:34.530
pages that cite

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.640
many other pages are good hubs, right?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.060
But the I think the most interesting

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.190
idea of this algorithm hits is.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.100
It's going to use reinforcement

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.820
mechanism to kind of help improve the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.070
scoring for hubs and authorities, and

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.730
here.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.780
So here's the idea.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.260
It would assume that good authorities

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.920
are cited by good hubs.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.025
That means if you're cited by many

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:05.060
pages with good hub scores, then that

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.630
increases your authority score and

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.178
similarly good hubs are those that pointed

00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:11.204
to good authorities.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.030
So if you get you pointed to a lot of

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.284
good authority pages, then your hub

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:17.620
score will be increased.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.370
So then we can iterate, reinforce each

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.439
other 'cause you can point to some good

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.028
hubs so that you can point to some good

00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:26.819
authorities to get a good hub score,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.469
whereas those authoritie scores.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.960
Would be also improved because they are

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.160
pointed to by a good hub and this

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.490
algorithm is also general.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.935
It can have many applications in graph

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:40.285
and network analysis.

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:42.880
So just briefly, here's how it works.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.030
We first also construct the matrix, but

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.460
this time we're going to construct the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.590
adjacency matrix and we're not going to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.810
normalize the values.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.670
So if there's a link, there is one.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.510
If there's no link that's zero again it's

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.400
the same graph.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700
And then we're going to define the Hub

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.520
score of page as the sum of the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.310
authority scores of all the pages that

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.190
it points to.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.870
So whether you are a hub really

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.870
depends on whether you're pointing to a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.400
lot of good authority pages.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.850
That's what it says in the first

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.326
equation.

00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:20.070
In the second equation, we define the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.280
authorities score over page as the sum

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.545
of the hub scores of all those pages

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.058
that the point to you.

00:02:27.058 --> 00:02:28.710
So whether you are good authoritie

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.454
would depend on whether those pages

00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:33.030
that are pointing to you are good hubs

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.030
so you can see this forms iterative

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.620
reinforcement mechanism.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.260
Now these two equations can be also

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.800
written in the matrix format.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.810
I saw what we get here is then the hub

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.060
vector is equal to the product of the

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.150
edges of the adjacency matrix and the authority

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.905
vector.

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:58.850
And this is basically the first

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.860
equation right?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.210
And similarly the second equation can

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.030
be returned as the authoritie vector is

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.200
equal to the product of A transpose

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.053
multiplied by the hub vector and

00:03:11.053 --> 00:03:13.530
these are just different ways of

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.350
expressing these equations.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.850
But what's interesting is that if you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.790
look at the metrics form, you can also

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.790
plug in the authority equation.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.540
Into the first one.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.690
So if you do that, you can actually

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.570
then eliminate the authoritie vector

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.820
completely and you get the equation of

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.778
only hub scores, right?

00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:38.589
The Hub score vector is equal to A * A

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.423
transpose multiplied by the hub score

00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:42.420
vector again.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.110
And similarly, we can do a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.505
transformation to have equation for

00:03:47.505 --> 00:03:49.430
just the authority scores.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.900
So although we framed the problem as

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.649
computing hubs and authorities, we can

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.250
actually eliminate one of them to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.840
obtain equation just for one of them.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.270
The difference between this and page

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.810
rank is that now the matrix is actually

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.915
a multiplication of the edges in the

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:08.480
matrix and its transpose, so this is

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.020
different from page rank.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.090
But mathematically, then we will be

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.820
computing the same problem.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.340
So in hits we typically would

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.130
initialize the values that said, one

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.269
for all these values and then we would

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.940
iteratively apply these equations,

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.710
essentially and

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.160
This is equivalent to multiply that by

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.660
the Matrix A and A transpose.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.020
So the algorithm is exactly the similar

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.270
page rank, but here because the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.010
adjacency matrix is not normalized.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.918
So what we have to do, what we have to

00:04:43.918 --> 00:04:46.010
do is after each iteration, we're going

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.470
to normalize and this would allow us to

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.750
control the growth of value, otherwise

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.952
they would grow larger and larger.

00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:54.950
And if we do that and then we'll

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.710
basically get hits algorithm to compute

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.750
the hub scores an authority scores for

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.620
all the pages.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.830
And these scores can then be used in

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.760
ranking just like a page rank scores.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.100
So to summarize, in this lecture we

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.194
have seen that link information is very

00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:14.652
useful.

00:05:14.652 --> 00:05:17.280
In particular, the anchor text is very

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.630
useful to increase the.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.889
The text representation of a page and

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.260
we also talk about page rank and hits on

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.980
as two major link analysis algorithms.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.670
Both can generate scores for web pages

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.590
that can be used in the ranking

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.410
function.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.850
Note that page rank and it's also very

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.070
general algorithms, so they have many

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.860
applications in analyzing other graphs

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.120
or networks.
