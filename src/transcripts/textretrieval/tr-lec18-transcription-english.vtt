00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.120
This lecture is about some practical

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.590
issues that you would have to address

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.160
in evaluation of text retrieval

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.780
systems.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.210
In this lecture we will continue the

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.240
discussion of evaluation we'll cover

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.930
some practical issues that you have to

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.280
solve in actual evaluation of text

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.310
retrieval systems.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.090
So,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.010
In order to create the test collection,

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.413
we have to create a set of queries, a

00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:33.690
set of documents and a set of relevance

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.370
judgments.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880
It turns out that each is actually

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.960
challenging to create.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.939
First, the documents and queries must

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.180
be representative.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.320
They must represent the real queries,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.695
and real documents that the users handle,

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.610
and we also have to use many queries

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.770
and many documents in order to avoid

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.140
biased conclusions.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.630
For the matching of relevant documents,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.620
with the queries we also need to ensure

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.475
that there exists a lot of relevant

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:09.700
documents for each query.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.380
If a query has only one, let's say

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.646
rather than the document in the

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:15.060
collection, then you know it's not very

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.980
informative to compare different

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.280
methods using such a query, because

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.400
there's not that much room for us to

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.920
see difference, so ideally there should

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.203
be more relevant documents in the

00:01:26.203 --> 00:01:28.005
collection, but yet the queries also

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.553
should represent the real queries that

00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:30.450
we care about.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.870
In terms of relevance judgments, the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.581
challenge is to ensure complete

00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:38.108
judgments of all the documents for all

00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:40.570
the queries, yet minimizing human

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.877
effort because we have to use human

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:45.150
labor to label these documents, it's

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.840
very labor intensive and as a result

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.345
it's impossible to actually label all

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:53.340
the documents for all the queries,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.550
especially considering a giant dataset

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.470
like the web.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.576
So this is actually a major challenge.

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:03.820
It's a very difficult challenge. For

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.250
measures,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.060
It's also challenging because we want

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.920
the measures that would accurately

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.980
reflect the perceived utility of users.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.620
We have to consider carefully what the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.630
users care about.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.220
And then design measures to measure

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.620
that.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.760
If your measure is not measuring the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.480
right thing, then your conclusion would

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.680
be misled.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.130
So it's very important.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.650
So, we're going to talk about a couple

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.240
of issues here.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.310
One is a statistical significance test

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.565
and this also is the reason why we have

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:35.555
to use a lot of queries.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.160
And the question here is how sure can

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.430
you be that observed difference that doesn't

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.990
simply result from the particular

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.540
queries you choose, so here are some

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.870
sample results of average position for

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.760
system A and system B in two different

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.630
experiments.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.870
And you can see in the bottom we have

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.379
mean average precision.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.256
So the mean if you look at the mean

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:01.100
average precision.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.180
The mean average precisions are exactly

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.130
the same in both experiments.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.445
So you can see this is 0.2.

00:03:10.445 --> 00:03:13.910
This is 0.4 for system B and again here,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.630
It's also 0.2 and 0.4, so

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.700
they are identical.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.810
Yet if you look at the these exact average

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.184
precisions for different queries. If you

00:03:23.184 --> 00:03:26.070
look at these numbers in detail,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.170
You will realize that, in one case you

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.190
would feel that you can trust the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.230
conclusion here given by the average.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.340
In another case, in the other case, you

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.890
will feel that well, I'm not sure.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.960
So why don't you take a look at all

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.810
these numbers

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.690
for a moment?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.860
Pause the video.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.390
So if you look at the average, the mean

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.680
average precision, we can easily say

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.590
that, well, system B is better, right?

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.530
So it's afterwards 0.4 and then this is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.030
twice as much as 0.2, so that's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.270
a better performance.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.190
But if you look at these

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.500
two experiments. Look at the detail

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.210
results,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.090
You will see that would be more

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.726
confident to say that in the case

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:17.340
one in experiment one.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.460
In this case, because these numbers

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.860
seem to be consistently better for

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.590
system B .

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.450
Whereas in experiment 2,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.060
We're not sure because looking at some

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.830
results like this.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.490
Actually System A is better and this is another

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.822
case.

00:04:36.822 --> 00:04:38.150
System A is better.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.410
But yet if we look at the only average,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.870
System B is better.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.620
So,Â 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:47.830
What do you think?

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.170
You know how reliable

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.630
Is our conclusion, if we only look at

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.260
the average?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.860
Now, in this case, intuitively we feel

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.430
experiment one

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.570
is more reliable.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.545
But how can we quantitatively answer

00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:04.410
this question?

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.020
And, This is why we need to do

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.520
statistical significance test.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.820
So the idea of statistical significance

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.950
test is basically to assess the variance

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.230
across these different queries.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.450
If there is a

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.700
A big variance that means the results

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.690
could fluctuate a lot according to

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.780
different queries.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.900
Then we should believe that unless you

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.320
have used a lot of queries, the results

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.895
might change if we use another set of

00:05:33.895 --> 00:05:34.300
queries.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.349
Right, so this is not. So,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.705
If you have see high variance then it's

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:42.890
not very reliable.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.390
So let's look at these

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.060
results again in the second case,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.440
right?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.520
So here we show two different ways to

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.080
compare them.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.070
One is signed test where we just look

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.200
at the sign. If system B is better than

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.340
system A, we have a plus sign when

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.009
SystemÂ  A is better,

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.520
we have a minus sign, etc.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.806
Using this case,

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:09.355
If you see this, well, there are seven cases.

00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:12.145
We actually have 4 cases where system B

00:06:12.145 --> 00:06:14.946
is better, but 3 cases System A is

00:06:14.946 --> 00:06:15.398
better.

00:06:15.398 --> 00:06:16.850
You intuitively.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.200
This is almost like a random result,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.447
right?

00:06:19.447 --> 00:06:22.820
So if you just take a random sample of

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.610
two to flip 7 coins, and if you use

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.825
plus to denote the head and then minus

00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:31.039
to denote the tail, and that could easily be the

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.130
results of just randomly flipping

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.516
these 7 coins.

00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:38.070
So the fact that the average is larger

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.170
doesn't tell us anything and we can

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.640
reliably conclude that, and this can be

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.435
quantitatively measured by a P value and

00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:47.460
that basically,Â 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.710
means the probability that this result

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.199
is infected from random fluctuation.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.289
In this case probability is 1.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.360
It means it surely is random

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.040
fluctuation.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.270
Now in Wilcoxon test, the nonparametric

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.555
test and we would be not only looking

00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:10.343
at the science will be also looking at

00:07:10.343 --> 00:07:13.210
the magnitude of the difference, but we

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.225
can draw a similar conclusion where you

00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:18.190
say it's very likely to be from random.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.890
So to illustrate this, let's think

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.950
about the

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.860
such a distribution and this is called

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:23.665
the null distribution.

00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:26.040
We assume that the mean is 0 here.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.870
This say we start with the

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.400
assumption that there's no difference

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.700
between the two systems.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.220
But we assume that because of random

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.150
fluctuations depending on the queries.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.109
We might observe a difference, so the

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.070
actual difference might be on the left

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.168
side here or on the right side here,

00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:43.879
right, so?

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.350
And this curve kind of shows the

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.460
probability that we will actually

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.180
observe values that are deviating from

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.520
zero here.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.990
Now, so if we look at this picture, then we

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.230
see that.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.450
If a difference is observed here,

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:04.850
then

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.760
the chance is very high that this is in

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.640
fact a random observation, right?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.760
We can define a region of you know likely

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.975
observation because of random

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:20.440
fluctuation, and this is 95% of all the

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.370
outcomes and in this interval then the

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.173
observed values may still be from

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:28.139
random fluctuation.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.010
But if you observe a value in this

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.480
region or a difference on this side,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.296
then the difference is unlikely from

00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:40.720
random fluctuation, right?

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.960
So there's a very small probability

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.410
that you will observe such a difference

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.436
just because of random fluctuation.

00:08:47.436 --> 00:08:50.140
So in that case we can then conclude

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.370
the difference must be real.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.870
So, System B is indeed better.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.820
So this is the idea of statistical

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.530
significance test. The takeaway message

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.070
here is that you have to use many

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.750
queries to avoid jumping into a

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.260
conclusion, as in this case to say

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.550
System B is better.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.520
There are many different ways of doing

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.400
this statistical significance test.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.380
So, now let's talk about the other

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.850
problem of making judgments.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.960
And as we said earlier, it's very hard

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.650
to judge all the documents completely

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.530
unless it's a very small data set.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.190
So the question is if we can afford

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.730
judging all the documents in the

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.510
collection, which is subset, should we

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:33.990
judge?

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.283
And the solution here is pulling and

00:09:38.283 --> 00:09:41.920
this is a strategy that has been used

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.930
in many cases to solve this problem.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.670
So the idea of pulling is the

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:49.130
following.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.290
We would first choose a diverse set of

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.250
ranking methods.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.100
These are text retrieval systems.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.230
And we hope these methods can help us

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.739
nominate likely relevant documents.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.722
So the goal is to figure out the

00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:06.080
relevant documents we want to make

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.970
judgments on relevant documents, because

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.350
those are the most useful documents

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.880
from users perspective.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.540
So then we're going to have each to

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.480
return top K documents.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.490
The "K" can vary from systems right?

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.360
But the point is to ask them to suggest

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.420
the most likely relevant documents.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.500
And then we simply combine all these

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.310
top K sets to form a pool

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.630
of documents for human assessors, to

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.170
judge.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.580
So imagine you have many systems, each

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.820
will return K documents, will take the

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.700
top K documents and we formed the

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.190
union.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.570
Now, of course there are many documents

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.730
that are duplicated bcause many systems

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.420
might have retrieved the same relevamnt

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.110
documents.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.872
So there will be some duplicate

00:10:54.872 --> 00:10:57.815
documents and there are also unique

00:10:57.815 --> 00:10:59.920
documents that are only returned by one

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.940
system and so the idea of having

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.660
diverse set of ranking methods is to

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.850
ensure the pool is broad and can

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.110
include as many possible relevant

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.340
documents as possible.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.030
And then the users would.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.880
Human assistance would make a

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.535
completely judgment on this data set

00:11:20.535 --> 00:11:21.430
this pool.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.530
And the other unjudged

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.900
documents are usually just assumed

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.030
to be non relevant.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.710
Now if the pool is large enough, this

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.970
assumption is OK.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.120
But the if the pool is not very large,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.660
this actually has to be

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.130
reconsidered and we might use other

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.880
strategies to deal with them, and there

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.380
are indeed other methods to handle such

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.870
cases, and such a strategy is generally

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.850
ok for comparing systems that

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.967
contributed to the pool.

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:55.820
That means if you participated in

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.950
contributing to the pool, then it's

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.830
unlikely that it will penalize your

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.700
system because the top ranked documents

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.730
have all been judged.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.140
However, this is problematic for

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.805
evaluating a new system that may have

00:12:09.805 --> 00:12:11.310
not contributed to the pool.

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.490
In this case, a new system might be

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.070
penalized because it might have

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.763
nominated some relevant documents that

00:12:18.763 --> 00:12:21.220
have not been judged, so those

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.520
documents might be assumed to be

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.280
non relevant.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.490
That's unfair.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:29.460
So to summarize, the whole part of text

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.930
retrieval evaluation, it's extremely

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.429
important because the problem is

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.130
empirically defined problem.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.450
If we don't rely on users, there's no

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.220
way to tell whether one method works

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.200
better. If we have inappropriate

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.800
experiment design, we might misguide

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.106
our research or applications and we

00:12:50.106 --> 00:12:51.567
might just draw wrong conclusions.

00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:54.100
And we have seen this in some of our

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.270
discussion, so make sure to get it

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.340
right for your research or application.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.737
The main methodology is Cranfield

00:13:01.737 --> 00:13:03.420
evaluation methodology and this is

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.550
still the main paradigm used in all

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.590
kinds of empirical evaluation tasks,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.180
not just the search engine evaluation.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.710
MAP and nDCG are the two main measures

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.630
that should definitely know about and they

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.440
are appropriate for comparing ranking

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.030
algorithms.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.010
You will see them often in research

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:21.600
papers.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.520
Proceeding at the 10 documents is

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.200
easier to interpret from the user's

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.110
perspective, so that's also often

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.730
useful.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.020
What's not covered is

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.350
Some other evaluation strategy like A-B Test

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.774
where the system would mix 2, the

00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:43.556
results of two methods randomly and

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.060
then will show the mixed results to

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.365
users.

00:13:46.365 --> 00:13:48.429
Of course the users don't see and which

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.796
result is from which method the users

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:52.820
would judge those results or click on

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.029
those documents in search engine

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.740
application.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.920
In this case then the search engine can

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.760
keep track of the, clicked documents

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.730
and see if one method has contributed

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.450
more.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.450
through the clicked documents, if the

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.510
user tends to click on one, the results

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:15.007
from one method, then it's just that the

00:14:15.007 --> 00:14:18.170
method may may be better, so this is

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.100
the leverage the real users of a search

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.915
engine to do evaluation.

00:14:20.915 --> 00:14:22.940
It's called A-B Test, and it's a

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.913
strategy that's often used by the modern

00:14:25.913 --> 00:14:27.239
search engines.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.480
Commercial search engines.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.960
Another way to evaluate IR or Text

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.130
retrieval is user studies, and we

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:35.980
haven't covered that.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.190
I've put some references here that you

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.780
can look at if you want to know more

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.460
about that.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.790
So there are three additional readings

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.160
here.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.210
These are three mini books about

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.560
evaluation and they all excellent in

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.550
covering a broad review of information

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.240
retrieval, evaluation, and discovered

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.870
some of the things that we discussed.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.450
But they also have a lot of others to

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:00.990
offer.
