00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.280
There are many more

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.850
advanced learning algorithms, then

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.090
the regression based approaches and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.560
they generally attempt to direct the

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.160
optimizer retrieval measure.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.910
like MAP or nDCG.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.710
Note that

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.180
the optimization objective function

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.280
that we have seen on the previous slide

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.160
is not directly related to retrieval

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.790
measure

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.770
By maximizing the prediction of one

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.360
or zero, we don't necessarily

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.070
optimize the ranking of those

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.750
documents.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.010
One can imagine that why our

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.180
prediction may not be too bad.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.060
Let's say both are around .5, so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.010
it's kinda of in the middle of zero and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.380
one for the two documents.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.340
But the ranking can be wrong, so we

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.440
might have got a larger value for

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.580
D2 and than D1.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.150
So that won't be good from retrieval

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
perspective, even though by likelihood

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.330
function is not bad.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.440
In contrast, we might have another case

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.670
where we predicted values all around

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.950
.9, let's say

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.605
and by the objective functioning

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:17.970
the error will be larger, but if we can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.680
get the order of the two documents

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.550
correct, that's actually a better

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.250
result.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.660
So these new, more advanced approaches

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.970
will try to correct that problem.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.990
Of course, then the challenge is that the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.820
optimization problem would be harder to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.040
solve and then researchers have

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.562
proposed many solutions to the problem

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:39.280
and you can read more

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.620
reference at the end to know more about

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.640
the these approaches.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.410
Now these learning to rank approaches

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.510
are actually general, so they can also be

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.450
applied to many other ranking problems,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.015
not just the retrieval problem.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:56.980
So here I list some, for example

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.370
recommender systems, computational

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.720
advertising or summarization and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.930
there are many others that you can

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.830
probably encounter in your

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.790
applications.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.370
To summarize this lecture we have

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.510
talked about the using machine learning

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.820
to combine multiple features to improve

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.330
ranking results.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.430
Actually the use of machine learning in information

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.980
retrieval has started since many

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.880
decades ago.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.083
So, for example, the Rocchio feedback

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.520
approaches that we talked about earlier

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.910
was machine learning approach applied

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.950
to relevance feedback

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.490
But the most recent use of machine

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.260
learning has been driven by some

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.000
changes in the environment of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.130
applications of retrieval systems, and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.150
first,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.000
it's mostly driven by the availability

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120
of a lot of training data in the form

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.140
of click throughs.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.440
Such data won't available before, so

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.700
the data can provide a lot of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.400
useful knowledge about the relevance

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.110
and machine learning methods can be

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.780
applied to leverage this.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.090
Secondly, it's also driven by the need

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.780
for combining many features and this is

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.800
not only just because there are more

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.060
features available on the web that can

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.370
be naturally used to improve scoring,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.210
it's also because by combining them

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.160
we can improve the robustness of

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.830
ranking, so this is desired for

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.040
combating spams.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.370
Modern search engines are all used,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.730
some kind of machine learning

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.020
techniques combined with many

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.390
features to optimize ranking and this

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.895
is a major feature of these commercial

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:53.750
engines such as Google or Bing.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.680
The topic of learning to rank is still

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.450
active research topic in the community

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.590
and so you can expect to see new

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.010
results being developed

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.880
in the next few years, perhaps.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.940
Here are some additional readings that

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.050
can give you more information about how

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.230
learning to rank works and also some

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.690
advanced methods.
