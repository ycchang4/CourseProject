00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.120
This lecture is about link analysis for

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.870
web search.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.620
In this lecture we're going to talk

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.270
about web search.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.840
And particularly focusing on how to do

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.630
link analysis and use the results to

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.560
improve search.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.740
The main topic of this lecture is to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.890
look at the ranking algorithms for web

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.400
search.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.320
In the previous lecture we talked about

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.550
how to create index now that we have

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.440
got index.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580
We want to see how we can improve

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.370
ranking of pages.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.610
Our standard IR models can be also

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.270
applied here.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.170
In fact they are important building

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.230
blocks for improvement for supporting

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.945
web search, but they aren't sufficient

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:58.480
and mainly for the following reasons.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.750
First, on the web we tend to have very

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.150
different information needs.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.710
For example, people might search for a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.760
web page or entry page and this is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.305
different from the traditional library

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:12.560
search where people are primarily

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.460
interested in collecting literature

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.030
information.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.880
So this kind of query is often called

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.905
navigational queries.

00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:21.380
The purpose is to navigate into a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.830
particular target page.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.790
So for such queries we might benefit

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.120
from using link information.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.520
Secondly, documents have additional

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.030
information and on the web web pages

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.540
are well format.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.530
There are a lot of other clues such as

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.340
the layout, title or link information.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.410
Again, so this has provided the

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.080
opportunity to use extra context

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.820
information.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.890
Of the document to improve scoring and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950
finally information quality varies a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.380
lot, so that means we have to consider

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.189
many factors to improve the ranking

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.950
algorithm.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.530
This would give us a more robust way to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.560
rank the pages, making it harder for

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.680
any spammer to just manipulate the one

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.610
signal to improve the ranking of a page.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.710
So as a result, people have made a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.470
number of major extensions to the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.520
ranking algorithms.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.600
One line is to exploit links to improve

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.310
scoring.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.470
And that's the main topic of this

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.920
lecture.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.650
People have also proposed algorithms to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.650
exploit the large scale

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.470
implicit feedback information in the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.850
form of click throughs, and that's of

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.610
course in the category of feedback

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.780
techniques. And machine learning is

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.800
often used there. In general in web

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.320
search the ranking algorithms are based on

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.780
machine learning algorithms to combine

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.230
all kinds of features.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.220
Many of them are based on the standard

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.390
visual models such as BM25 that we

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.310
talked about.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.990
Or query likelihood to score different

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.287
parts of documents or to provide

00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:06.490
additional features based on content

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.210
matching, but link information is also

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.690
very useful so they provide additional

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.480
scoring.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.680
Signals.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.474
So let's look at links in more detail

00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:21.627
on the web.

00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:25.352
So this is a snapshot of some part of the

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.490
web and say so we can see there are

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.370
many links that link the different

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.985
pages together, and in this case you

00:03:31.985 --> 00:03:35.241
can also look at the center here.

00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:37.800
There is a description of a link that's

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.430
pointing to the document on the right

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.290
side.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.040
Now this description text is called

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.010
anchor text.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.880
Now if you think about the this text, it's

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.600
actually quite a useful because it

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.980
provides some extra description of that

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.600
page being pointed to.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.520
So for example, if someone wants to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.790
bookmark Amazon.com, front page the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.890
person might say.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.020
The biggest online bookstore and then

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.500
with the link to Amazon.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.100
Right, so the description here actually

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.970
is very similar to what the user will

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.410
type in the query box when they are

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.630
looking for such a page, and that's why

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.800
it's very useful for ranking pages.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.020
Suppose someone types in query like

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.600
online bookstore or fixed online

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.100
bookstore.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.060
The query would match this anchor text.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.120
In the page.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.550
Here and then, this actually provides

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.900
evidence for matching the page that's

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.090
being pointed to.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.260
That is the Amazon entry page.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.160
So if you match the anchor text that

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.600
describes a link to a page, actually

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.430
that provides good evidence for the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.190
relevance of the page being pointed to,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.730
so anchor text is very useful.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.429
If you look at the bottom part of this

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.960
picture you can also see there are some

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.730
patterns of links, and these links

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.280
might indicate the utility of a

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.210
document.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.392
So for example on the right side you

00:05:10.392 --> 00:05:12.120
can see this page has received, many

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.990
in links.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.630
That means many other pages are

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.240
pointing to this page and this shows

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.470
that this page is quite useful.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.640
On the left side you can see, this is another

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.870
page that points to many other pages,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.150
so this is a directory page that

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.275
would allow you to actually see a lot

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:31.400
of other pages.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.610
So we can call the first case authority

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.470
page and the second case half page.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.400
This means the link information can

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.220
help in two ways.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.820
One is to provide extra text for matching

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.300
and the other is to provide some

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.870
additional scores for the web pages to

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.960
characterize how likely a pages have,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.300
how likely a pages authority.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.390
So people then of course proposed

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.360
ideas to leverage these in this link

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.930
information.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.790
Now Google's Pagerank, which was the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.110
main technique that they used in early

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.250
days, is a good example and that is an

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.140
algorithm to capture page popularity,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.380
basically to score authority.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.280
So the intuition's here are links are

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.070
just like a citations in the

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.570
literature.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.290
Think about one page pointing to

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.830
another page.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.899
This is very similar to one paper

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.160
citing another paper.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.450
So of course, then if a page is cited

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.439
often, then we can assume this page to

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.220
be more useful, in general.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.850
So that's a very good intuition.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.290
Now Pagerank is essentially to take

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.700
advantage of this intuition to

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.130
implement it with the principled

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.220
approach.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.670
Intuitively, it's essentially doing

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.845
citation counting or in link counting.

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:54.890
It just improves this simple idea in

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.700
two ways.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.830
One is it would consider indirect

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.990
citations.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.312
So that means you don't just look at

00:07:01.312 --> 00:07:03.430
the how many in links you have.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.390
You also look at the what are those

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.930
pages that are pointing to you.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.890
If those pages themselves have a lot of

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.268
in links, well that means a lot.

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:15.050
In some sense you will get some credit

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.620
from them.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.080
But, if those pages that are

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.710
pointing to you are not being pointed

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.895
to by other pages, they themselves

00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:26.025
don't have many in links then, well, you

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:27.440
don't get that much credit.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.890
So that's the idea of getting

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.060
indirected citation.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.190
Alright you can also understand this idea

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.040
by looking at again the research

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.580
papers.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.387
If you're cited by let's say 10 papers

00:07:39.387 --> 00:07:42.906
and those 10 papers are just workshop

00:07:42.906 --> 00:07:47.690
papers and or some papers that are not

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.640
very influential, right?

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.430
So although you get 10 in links and

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.254
that's not as good as if you were cited

00:07:55.254 --> 00:07:58.240
by 10 papers that themselves have

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.270
attracted a lot of other citations.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.910
So this is.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.610
A case where we would like to consider

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.743
indirect links and Pagerank does

00:08:08.743 --> 00:08:09.206
that.

00:08:09.206 --> 00:08:11.590
The other idea is it's going to smooth

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.040
the citations or assume that basically

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.410
every page is having a non zero pseudo

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:21.030
citation count.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.860
Essentially we're trying to imagine

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.440
there are many virtual links that will

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.720
link all the pages together so that you

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.300
actually get pseudo citations from

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:32.970
everyone.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.630
The reason why they want to do that is

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.140
this would allow them to solve the

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.110
problem elegantly with.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.690
Linear algebra technique.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.350
So.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.470
I think maybe the best way to

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.220
understand the page rank is through.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.590
Think of this as do computer

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.470
the probability of random surfer, visiting

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.690
every web page.
