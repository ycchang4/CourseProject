00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.230
In this lecture we continue the

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.604
discussion of vector space model.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.240
In particular, we're going to talk

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.590
about the TF transformation. In the

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.870
previous lecture, we have derived a TF

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.954
IDF weighting formula using the vector

00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:15.730
space model.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.510
And we have shown that this model

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.020
actually works pretty well for these

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.090
examples, as shown on this slide except

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.615
for D5, which has received very high

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:41.240
score.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.415
Indeed, it has received the highest

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.430
score among all these documents, but

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.000
this document is intuitively non

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.300
relevant, so this is not desirable.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.170
In this lecture we're gonna talk about

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.180
how we can use TF transformation to

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.130
solve this problem.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.830
Before we discuss the details, let's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.520
take a look at the formula for this

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.040
simple TF IDF weighting ranking

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.590
function and see why this document has

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.410
received such a high score.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.656
So this is the formula and if you look

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:16.400
at the formula

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.580
carefully, then you will see it

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.890
involves a sum over all the matched

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.820
query terms.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.750
And inside the sum, each matching query term

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.900
has a particular weight and this way it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.550
is TF IDF weighting.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.390
So it has an idea of component where we

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.770
see two variables.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.405
One is the total number of documents in

00:01:39.405 --> 00:01:40.180
the collection.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.850
And that is M.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.137
The other is the document frequency.

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:47.370
This is the number of documents that

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.480
contain this word W.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.350
The other variables involved in the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.170
formula included the count of the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.920
query, term

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.500
Term.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.440
W in the query and the count of the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.200
word in the document.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.350
If you look at this document again, now

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.710
it's not hard to realize that the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.970
reason why it hasn't received the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.480
highest score is be cause it has a very

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.930
high count of campaign.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.382
So the count of campaign in this

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:26.790
document is a four which is much higher

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.430
than the other documents and has

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.528
contributed to the high score of this

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:31.769
document.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.510
So intuitively, in order to lower the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.390
score for this document, we need to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.555
somehow restrict the contribution of

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:43.160
the matching of this term in the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.490
document.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.700
And if you think about the matching of

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.290
terms in a document carefully, you

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990
actually would realize.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.490
We probably shouldn't reward multiple

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.350
occurrences.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.130
So generously.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.786
By that I mean the first occurrence of

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:05.690
term says a lot about the matching of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.750
this term because it goes from zero

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.840
count to a count of 1 and that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.670
increase

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.470
means a lot.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.100
Once we see a word in the document,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.660
it's very likely that the document is

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.840
talking about this word.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.840
If we see a extra occurrence on top of

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.890
the first occurrence,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.510
that is to go from one to two.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.550
Then we also

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.430
can say that was the 2nd occurrence.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.470
Kind of confirmed that it's not a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.200
accidental matching of the word.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.310
Now we are more sure that this document

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.550
is talking about this word.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.580
But imagine we have seen, let's say, 50

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.350
times of the word in the document.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.230
Then adding one extra occurrence is not

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.580
good to tell us more about the evidence

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.905
'cause we already sure that this

00:03:57.905 --> 00:03:59.880
document is about this word.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.490
So if you think in this way, it seems

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.090
that we should restrict the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.830
contribution of high count of term.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.310
And that is the idea of TF

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.320
transformation.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.180
So this transformation function is

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.620
going to turn the raw count of word

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.360
into a term frequency, wait for the

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.410
word in the document.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.980
So here I show in X axis the raw count.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.070
In Y axis I showed term frequency

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.590
weight.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.510
So in the previous ranking functions we

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.440
actually have implicitly used some kind

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.350
of transformation.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.490
For example, in the 01 bit vector

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.920
representation, we actually use

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.650
researcher transformation function as

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.970
shown here.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.900
Basically, if the count is 0, then it

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.310
has zero weight, otherwise it would

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.070
have a weight of 1.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.680
It's a flat.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.490
Now, what about using term count as

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.890
TF wait, that's the linear function,

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.260
right?

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.760
So it has just exactly the same way as

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.450
the count.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.130
We have just seen that this is

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.940
not desirable.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.433
So what we want is something like this.

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:22.460
So for example, with the logarithm

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.330
function, we can have a sub linear

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.760
transformation that looks like this and

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.690
this would control the influence of

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.400
really high weight because it's going

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.780
to lower its inference, yet it will

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.170
retain the inference of small counts.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.720
Or we might want to even bend the curve

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.620
more by applying logarithm twice.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.900
Now people have tried all these methods

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.640
and they are indeed working better than

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.800
the linear form of the transformation.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.470
But so far what works the best seems to

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.180
be this

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.860
special transformation called  BM25

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.150
transformation. BM stands for best

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.620
matching.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.080
Now in this transformation you can see

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.140
there's a parameter K here.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.000
And this K controls the upper bound of

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.790
this function.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.740
It's easy to see this function has

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.390
upper bound.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.590
Because if you look at the x / x + K

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.570
where K is non negative number then the

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.970
numerator will never be able to exceed

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.090
the denominator, right?

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.150
So it's upper bounded by K + 1.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.336
This is also difference between this

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:34.630
transformation function and the

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.960
logarithm transformation

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.730
which doesn't have upper bound.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.940
Furthermore, 1 interesting property of

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.985
this function is that as we vary K,

00:06:44.985 --> 00:06:48.510
we can actually simulate a different

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.756
transformation functions, including the

00:06:50.756 --> 00:06:52.770
two extremes that I've shown here.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.850
That is a 01 bit transformation and the

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.340
linear transformation.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.170
So for example, if we set K to 0

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.250
now you can see,

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.220
the function value would be 1.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.100
So we precisely recover

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.500
the 01 bit transformation.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.840
If you set K to a very large

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.610
number, on the other hand is going to

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.990
look more like the linear

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.130
transformation function.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.200
So in this sense, this transformation

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.410
is very flexible.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.190
It allows us to control the

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.430
shape of the transformation.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.289
It also has a nice block of the

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.010
upper bound.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.350
And this upper bound is useful to

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.170
control the influence of a particular

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.560
time.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.160
And so that we can

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.290
prevent a spammer from just increasing

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.640
the count of one term to spam all

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.010
queries that might match this time.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.350
In other words, this upper bound might

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.280
also ensure that all terms would be

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.530
counted when we aggregate the weights

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.500
to computer score.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.930
As I said, this transformation function

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.860
has worked well so far.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.890
So to summarize this lecture.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.950
The main point is that we need to do

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.350
some linear TV TF transformation, and

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.960
this is needed to capture the intuition

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.030
of diminishing return from higher term

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.620
counts.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.580
It's also to avoid dominance by one

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.710
single term over all others. This BM25

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.310
 transformation that we

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.060
talked about

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.970
is very interesting.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.780
It's so far one of the best performing

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.430
TF transformation formulas.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.525
It has upper bound and social robust

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.620
and effective.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.245
If you plug this function into our

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:53.720
TF IDF weighting vector space model.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.920
then we would end up having the

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.630
following ranking function which has a

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.950
BM 25 TF component.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.810
Now this is

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.230
already very close to

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:06.520
2.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.300
a state of the art ranking function

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.950
called BM 25.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.630
And will discuss how we can further

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.970
improve this formula in the next

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:17.460
lecture.
