00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.900
So let's take a look at this in detail.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.600
So in this random surfing model.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.310
At any page would assume random surfer

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.900
would choose the next page to visit, so

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.210
this is a small graph here.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.333
That's of course oversimplification of

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.160
the complicated web, but let's say

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.762
there are four documents here, d1 d2 d3

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:36.750
and d4, and let's assume that a random

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.403
surfer or random walker can be on any

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:40.410
of these pages.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.070
And then the random surfer could decide

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.570
to just randomly jump into any page.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.530
Or follow a link and then visit the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.250
next page.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.100
So if the random server is at d1.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.720
Then

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.420
With some probability that random surfer

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.170
will follow the links.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.010
Now there are two out links here.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.520
One is pointing to d3, the other

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.939
is pointing to d4, so the random

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.879
surfer could pick any of these two to

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.080
reach d3 and d4.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.379
But it also assumes that the random

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.926
surfer might get bored sometimes, so

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:28.320
the random surfer will decide to ignore

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.150
the actual links and simply randomly

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.560
jump to any page on the web.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.640
So if it does that, it would be able to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.390
reach any of the other pages, even

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.980
though there's no link directly from d1

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.210
to that page.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.810
So this is assumed random surfing

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.340
model.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.813
Imagine a random surfer is really doing

00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:54.290
a surfing like this.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.970
Then we can ask the question how likely

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.700
on average the surfer would actually

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.380
reach

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.070
a particular page like d1 or d2

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.900
or d3 really, that's the average

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.020
probability of visiting a particular

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.360
page.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.303
And this probability is precisely what

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:13.740
Pagerank computes.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470
So the Pagerank score of the document

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.913
is the average probability that

00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:20.980
the surfer visits a particular page.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.230
Now, intuitively, this would basically

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.480
capture the in link account.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.305
Why?

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:30.580
Because if a page has a lot of in links,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.260
then it would have a higher chance of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.250
being visited because there will be

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.510
more opportunities of having the surfer

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.059
to follow a link to come to this page.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.830
And this is why.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.210
The random surfing model actually captures the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.990
idea of counting the in links.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.560
Note that it also considers the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.920
indirect in links.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.620
Why? Because if the pages

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.780
that point to you have themselves a lot

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.630
of in links.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.760
That would mean the random surfer will

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.630
very likely reach one of them, and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.510
therefore it increases the chance of

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.406
visiting you.

00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:10.130
So this is a nice way to capture both

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.045
indirect and direct links.

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:14.320
So mathematically, how can we compute

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.205
this probability in order to see that

00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:19.801
we need to take a look at how this

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:21.080
probability is computed.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.789
So first, let's take a look at the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.190
transition matrix here.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.010
And this is just the metrics with

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.565
values indicating how likely I ran.

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:32.248
The random surfer will go from one page

00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:36.310
to another, so each row stands for a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.996
starting page.

00:03:36.996 --> 00:03:39.250
For example, row one would indicate

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.280
the probability of going to any other 4

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.720
pages from d1, and here we see

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.640
there are only two non zero entries,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.380
each is 1 over 2.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.620
So, this is because if you look at

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.500
the graph d1 is pointing to d3

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.734
and d4, there is no link from d1

00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:08.300
to d1 itself or d2, so we've got zeros for

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.561
the first 2 columns and .5 for d3 and

00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.355
d4.

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:19.160
In general, the element in this matrix

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.900
M sub i, j is the probability of going

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.470
from

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.780
d,i to d,j and obviously for each

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.830
row the values should sum to 1 because

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.130
the surfer would have to go to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.980
precisely one of these other pages,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.190
right?

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.790
So this is the transition matrix.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.350
Now, how can we compute the probability

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.890
of a surfer visiting a page?

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.770
If you look at the surf model then

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.140
basically we can compute the

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.940
probability of reaching a page as

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.560
follows.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.980
So.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.905
Here on the left hand side you see it's

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:04.130
the probability of visiting page d,j at

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.030
time T + 1, so it's the next time

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.540
point.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.450
On the right hand side you can see the

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.030
equation involves the probability of at

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.310
Page d,i at time T.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.070
So you can see the subscript index t

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.480
here, and that indicates that the

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.090
probability that the surfer was at a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.810
document at time t.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.640
So.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.703
The equation basically captures the two

00:05:39.703 --> 00:05:42.400
possibilities of reaching at d,j at

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.690
time T + 1.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.410
What are these two possibilities?

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.130
One is through random surfing and

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.110
one is through following a link as we

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.060
just explained.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.193
So the first part captures the

00:05:56.193 --> 00:05:58.209
probability that the random surfer

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.480
would reach this page by following a

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.859
link, and you can see the random surfer

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.366
chooses this strategy with probability

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:11.360
1 minus alpha as we assume and so there

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.120
is a factor of 1 minus alpha here, but

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.470
the main part is really sum over all

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.840
the possible pages that the surfer

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.390
could have been at time t.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.530
There are N pages, so it's a sum

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.350
over all the possible N pages. Inside

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.160
the sum is a product of two

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.180
probabilities.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.470
One is the probability that the

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.090
surfer was at d,i the time t.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.350
That's p sub t of d,i.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.570
The other is the transition probability

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.920
from the d,i to d,j.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.335
And so in order to reach this d,j page,

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:56.447
the surfer must first be at d,i at

00:06:56.447 --> 00:06:59.655
time t and then also would have

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:02.361
to follow the link to go from the d,i

00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:03.148
to d,j.

00:07:03.148 --> 00:07:05.476
So the probability is the probability

00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:08.550
of being at d,i at time t multiplied

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.660
by the probability of going from that

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.660
page to the target page.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.470
d,j here.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.040
The second part is a similar sound.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.980
The only difference is that now the

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.880
transition probability is a uniform

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.462
transition probability of 1 / N and

00:07:25.462 --> 00:07:27.206
this part of captures the probability

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:30.700
of reaching this page through random

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.200
jumping.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.670
Right, so the form is exactly the same and

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.060
is.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.230
This also allows us to see why Pagerank

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.420
essentially assume the smoothing

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.220
of the transition matrix.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.750
If you think about this 1 / N as coming

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.650
from another transition matrix that has

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.880
all the elements being 1 / N The

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.300
uniform matrix, then you can see very

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.775
clearly.

00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:58.940
Essentially we can merge the two parts.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.890
And because they are of the same form, we

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.000
can imagine there's a different matrix

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.480
that's a combination of this M and that

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.086
uniform matrix, where every element is

00:08:10.086 --> 00:08:13.540
1 / N, and in this sense Pagerank

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.500
uses this idea of smoothing and

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.940
ensuring that there's no zero entry in

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.390
such a transition matrix.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.270
Now of course this is time dependent

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.400
calculation of probabilities.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.320
Now we can imagine if we want to

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.598
compute the average probabilities, the

00:08:32.598 --> 00:08:34.470
average probabilities probably would

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.990
satisfy this equation without

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.389
considering the time index.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.410
So let's drop the time index and just

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:41.930
assume that they will be equal.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.200
Now this would give us N equations

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.320
because for each page we have such

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.410
equation and if you look at the what

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.720
variables will have in these equations

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.280
there are also precisely N variables.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:56.900
Right?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.680
So this basically means we now have a

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.090
system of N equations with N variables.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.330
And these are linear equations.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.340
So basically the problem boils down to

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.750
solve this system of equations.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.570
And here I also showed the equations in

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.850
the matrix form.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.000
It's the vector p here.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.220
Equals a metrics of the transverse of

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.750
the matrix here.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.660
And multiply by the vector again.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.460
Now, if you still remember some

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.970
knowledge that you've learned from

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.820
linear algebra and then you will

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.540
realize this is precisely the equation

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.920
for item vector, right when you multiply

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.400
the matrix by this vector, you get the

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.860
same value as this vector.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.060
And this can be solved by using

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.510
iterative algorithm.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.310
So the equations here on above are

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.660
basically taken from the previous

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.410
slide, so you see the relation between

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.040
the.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.070
The Pagerank scores of different pages

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.635
and in this iterative approach or power

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:15.840
approach, we simply start with.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.480
Randomly initialized vector p and

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.885
then we repeatedly just updated this p

00:10:23.885 --> 00:10:29.212
by multiplying the matrix here by this

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:30.160
p vector.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.730
So I also show a concrete example here.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.360
So you can see this now if we assume

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.045
alpha is .2, then with the example that

00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:47.810
we show here on this slide we have the

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.980
original transition matrix here.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.310
Right? That includes the

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.770
graph, the actual links, and we have

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.750
this smoothing transition matrix

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.390
uniform transition matrix representing

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.200
random jumping and we can combine them

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.300
together with a linear interpolation to

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.570
form another matrix.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.230
That would be like this.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.100
So essentially we can imagine now the

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.100
web looks like this. Can be captured by

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.930
that there are virtual links between

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.220
all the pages now.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.300
So the Pagerank algorithm would just

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.605
initialize the p vector first and then

00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:30.510
just compute the updating of this p

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.150
vector by using this matrix

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.090
multiplication.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.800
Now if you rewrite this matrix model

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.040
multiplication in terms of just,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.780
individual equations, you will see

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.120
this.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.710
And this is

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.709
Basically the updating formula for this

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.590
particular pages Pagerank score so you

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.260
can also see you if you want to compute

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.730
the value of this updated score for d1

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.180
you basically multiply this rule.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.200
Right, by this column.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.420
And we take the dot product of the two.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.660
That would give us the value for this

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.090
value.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.370
So this is how we updated the vector.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.200
We started with some initial values for

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.060
these guys.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.810
For this and then we just revise

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.503
the scores we generate a new set of

00:12:28.503 --> 00:12:31.110
scores and the updating formula is this

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.520
one.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.390
So we just repeatedly apply this and

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.230
here it converges and when the metrics

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.740
is like this where there's no zero

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.580
values and it can be guaranteed to

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.350
converge.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.900
And at that point that we will just

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.710
have the Pagerank scores for all the

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:49.830
pages. Now

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.840
we typically set the initial values

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.530
just to 1 / N.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.570
So Interestingly, this updating formula

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.990
can be also interpreted as propagating

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.180
scores over the graph.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.260
Can you see why?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.780
If you look at this formula and then

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.510
compare that with this graph?

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.570
And can you imagine how we might be

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.740
able to interpret this as essentially

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.910
propagating scores over the graph?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.540
I hope you will see that indeed we can

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.445
imagine we have values initialized on

00:13:22.445 --> 00:13:25.386
each of these pages, so we can have

00:13:25.386 --> 00:13:26.109
values here.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.570
Let's say that's 1 /4 for each, and

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.270
then we're going to use this matrix to

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.130
update these scores.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.780
And if you look at the equation here.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.920
This one.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.590
Basically, we're going to combine the scores

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.370
of the pages that possibly would lead

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.820
to reaching this page, so we'll look at

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.704
all the pages that are pointing to this

00:13:51.704 --> 00:13:54.640
page and then combine their scores and

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.090
propagate the score.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.780
The sum of the scores to this document

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.475
d1.

00:14:00.475 --> 00:14:05.530
So we look at the scores that represent

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.490
the probability that the random surfer

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.170
will be visiting the other pages before

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.140
it reached d1, and then just do

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.636
the propagation to simulate the

00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:20.520
probability of reaching this page.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.390
d1.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.415
So there are two interpretations.

00:14:23.415 --> 00:14:26.125
One is just the matrix multiplication

00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:27.650
and repeatedly

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.380
multiply the vector by this matrix, but

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.880
the other is to just think of it as

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.890
propagating the scores repeatedly on

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:37.650
the web.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.960
So in practice the computation of

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.860
Pagerank score is actually efficient

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.950
because the matrix is sparse and there

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.830
are some ways to transform the equation

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.510
so that you avoid actually literally

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.720
computing the values for all those

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.350
elements.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.660
Sometimes you may also normalize the

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.230
equation and that would give you a

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.679
somewhat different form of the

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.120
equation, but then the ranking of pages

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.390
will not change.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.240
The results of this potential problem of

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.639
zero out link problem.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.910
In that case, if the page does not have

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:17.480
any out link then the probability of

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.230
these pages would not sum to one

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.060
basically the probability of reaching

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.830
the next page from this page will not sum to one.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.060
Mainly because we have lost

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.940
some probability mass when we assume

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.910
there's some probability that the

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:34.340
surfer will try to follow links,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.419
but then there's no link to follow.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.870
And one possible solution is simply to

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.885
use a page specific damping factor

00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:44.790
and that could easily fix this.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.480
Basically, that's to say alpha would be

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.770
1.0 for a page with no out out link.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.705
In that case the surfer would just have

00:15:53.705 --> 00:15:55.890
to randomly jump through another page

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.700
instead of trying to follow a link.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.860
So there are many extensions of page

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.300
rank.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.983
One extension is to do topic specific

00:16:03.983 --> 00:16:06.380
Pagerank. Noted that Pagerank doesn't

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.960
really use the query information so.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.062
So we can make Pagerank query

00:16:14.062 --> 00:16:16.890
specific, however, so for example in

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.140
the topic specific Pagerank we can

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.400
simply assume when the surfer is bored

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.880
the surfer is not going to randomly

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.540
jump to any page on the web.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.310
Instead it's going to jump to only

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.804
those pages that are relevant to a

00:16:31.804 --> 00:16:32.143
query.

00:16:32.143 --> 00:16:34.124
For example, if the queries is about the

00:16:34.124 --> 00:16:36.268
sports, then we could assume that when

00:16:36.268 --> 00:16:38.536
it's doing random jumping it's going to

00:16:38.536 --> 00:16:40.499
randomly jump to a sports page.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.752
By doing this, then we can bias and

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:43.600
Pagerank to

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.600
topic like sports and then if you know the

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.347
current query is about sports and then

00:16:48.347 --> 00:16:50.910
you can use this specialized Pagerank

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.690
score to rank documents that would be

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.680
better than if you use a generic

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.420
Pagerank score.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.670
Pagerank is also a general algorithm

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.170
that can be used in many other

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.700
applications for network analysis,

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.990
particularly for example social

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.760
networks.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.120
You can imagine if you compute the

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.810
Pagerank scores for social network

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.160
where a link might indicate friendship

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.070
relation, you'll get some meaningful

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.570
scores for people.
