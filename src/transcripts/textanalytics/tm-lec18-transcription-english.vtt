00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.030
So now let's talk about the problem

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.346
a little bit more and specifically, let's

00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:07.240
talk about the two different ways of

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.920
estimating parameters.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.550
One is called maximum likelihood

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.960
estimate that I already just mentioned.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.690
The other is Bayesian estimation.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080
So in Maximum likelihood estimation, we

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.580
define best as meaning the data likelihood

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.799
has reached the maximum, so

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700
formally it's given by this expression

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.000
here.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.290
Where we define the estimate as 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.060
arg max

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.360
of the probability of X given Theta.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.590
And so arg max here just means it's

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.780
actually a function that would return

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.190
the argument that gives the function

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.860
maximum value as the value, so the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.482
value of arg max is not the value of this

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:03.830
function, but rather the argument that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.865
has made the function reach maximum.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.880
So in this case the value of argmax is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.410
Theta.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.280
It's the Theta that makes the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.310
probability of X given Theta reach its

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.935
maximum, so this estimate intuitively

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.960
also makes sense, and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.035
it's often very useful, and it seeks

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.840
the parameters that best explain the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.270
data.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.380
But it has a problem when the data is

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.071
too small, because when the data points

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.099
are too small,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.957
there are very few data points.

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.513
The sample is small,

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.220
then if we trust data entirely and try

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.020
to fit the data and then we will be

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.830
biased.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.890
So in the case of text data, let's say

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.980
our observed 100 words did not contain

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.700
another word related to text mining,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.230
then our maximum likelihood estimator

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.740
would give that word zero probability.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.060
Because giving a non zero

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.665
probability would take away probability

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.550
mass from some observed words which

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.890
obviously is not optimal in terms of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.426
maximizing the likelihood of the

00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:10.110
observed data.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.980
But this zero probability for all the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.250
unseen words may not be reasonable

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.840
sometimes, especially if we want the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.950
distribution to characterize the topic

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.135
of text mining.

00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:27.933
So one way to address this problem is

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.660
actually to use Bayesian estimation,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.510
where we actually would look at

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.540
both the data and all our prior

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.580
knowledge about the parameters.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.500
We assume that we have some prior

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.089
belief about the parameters.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.860
Now in this case, of course, so we are

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.870
not going to look at just the data, but

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.030
also look at the prior so the prior

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.950
here is defined by P of Theta.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.930
And this means we will impose some

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.330
preference on certain Thetas over

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.900
others.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.880
And by using Bayes rule that I have

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.860
shown here,

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.620
we can then combine the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.630
likelihood function with the prior

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.330
to give us this

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.410
posterior

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.340
probability of the parameter.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.299
Now a full explanation of Bayes Rule

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.640
and some of these things related to

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.990
Bayesian reasoning would be outside

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.940
the scope of this course, but I just

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.633
give a brief introduction because this

00:03:41.633 --> 00:03:43.360
is a general knowledge that might be

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.160
useful for you, so the Bayes rule is

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.760
basically defined here.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.522
And allows us to write down one

00:03:52.522 --> 00:03:55.760
conditional probability of X given Y in

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.580
terms of the conditional probability of

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.020
Y given X.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.808
And you can see the two probabilities

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:05.840
are two conditional probabilities are

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.869
different in the order of the two

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.010
variables, but often the rule is used

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.120
for making inferences of

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.750
a variable.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.080
So let's take a look at it

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.650
again, we can assume that P of X

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.930
encodes our prior belief about the X.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.660
That means before we observe any other

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.720
data, that's our belief about X, what

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.000
we believe some X values have higher

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.380
probability than others.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.720
And this probability of X given Y is a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.578
conditional probability, and this is

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:51.500
our posterior belief about X, because

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.370
this is our belief about X values after

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.000
we have observed Y.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.990
Given that we have observed Y, now

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.938
what do we believe about X now, do we

00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:04.500
believe

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.850
some values have high probabilities

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.560
than others?

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.600
Now, the two probabilities are related

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.190
through this can be regarded as the

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.200
probability of

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.770
the observed evidence Y

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.850
here given a particular X.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.370
So you can think about X as our

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.280
hypothesis.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.190
And we have some prior belief about

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.970
which hypothesis to choose and after we have

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.860
observed Y, we will update our belief

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.110
and this updating formula is based on

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.840
the combination of our prior here and

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.570
the likelihood of observing this Y if X

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.180
is indeed true.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.790
So much for a detour about Bayes Rule.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.390
So in our case, what we're interested

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.920
in is inferring the theta values so

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.660
we have a prior here.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.760
That includes our prior knowledge about

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.690
the parameters.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.710
And then we have the data likelihood

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.200
here that would tell us which parameter

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.110
value can explain the data well.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.240
The posterior probability combines both

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.110
of them.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.460
So it represents a compromise of the

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.650
two preferences.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.610
And in such a case, we can maximize

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.900
this posterior probability to find a

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.570
theta that would maximize

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.100
this posterior probability.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.600
And this estimator is called the Maximum

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.440
a Posteriori or MAP estimate.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.030
And this estimate is a more

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.690
general estimate than the maximum

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.860
likelihood estimate.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.280
Because once if we define our prior as a

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.480
noninformative prior meaning that it's

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.830
uniform over all the theta values,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.150
no preference, then,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.648
we basically would go back to the

00:07:15.648 --> 00:07:17.410
maximum likelihood estimator because in

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.100
such a case it's mainly going to be

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.840
determined by this likelihood value

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.680
here.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.610
The same as here.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.820
OK, but if we have some informative

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.100
prior, some bias towards certain values,

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.500
then MAP estimate

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.170
can allow us to incorporate that,

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.080
but the problem here of course is how

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.480
to define the prior.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.470
There's no free lunch, and if you want

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.900
to solve the problem with more

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.785
knowledge, we have to have that

00:07:50.785 --> 00:07:52.670
knowledge and that knowledge ideally

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.780
should be reliable.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.760
Otherwise your estimate may not

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.320
necessarily be more accurate than

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.600
maximum likelihood estimate.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.860
Now let's look at the Bayesian

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.060
estimation in more detail.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.680
OK, so I show the theta values as

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.880
just one dimension value and that's a

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.350
simplification of course.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.220
So we're interested in which value of

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.240
data is optimal.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.345
So now first we have the prior.

00:08:27.345 --> 00:08:30.100
The prior tells us some theta values are

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.195
more likely than others.

00:08:31.195 --> 00:08:33.500
We believe, for example,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.990
these values are more likely than the

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.310
values like here or here or other

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.020
places.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.980
So this is our prior.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.390
And then we have our data likelihood.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.130
In this case, the data also tells us

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.430
which values of theta are more likely

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.410
and that just means those theta values

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.940
can best explain our data.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.689
And then when we combine the two, we

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.290
get the posterior distribution and

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.410
that's just a compromise of the two.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.920
It would say that it's somewhere in

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.520
between, so we can now look at some

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.570
interesting point estimates of theta.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.243
Now this point represents the mode of

00:09:19.243 --> 00:09:19.566
prior.

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:21.270
That means the most likely parameter

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.240
value according to our prior before we

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.310
observe any data.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.010
This point is the maximum likelihood

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.990
estimate that represents the theta that

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.650
gives the data the maximum probability.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.843
Now this point is interesting.

00:09:33.843 --> 00:09:36.540
It's the posterior mode, it's the.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.540
It's the most likely value of theta

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.375
given by the posterior distribution,

00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:44.495
and it represents a good compromise of

00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:47.830
the prior mode and the maximum likehood

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.190
estimate.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.920
In general, in Bayesian inference we

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.110
are interested in the distribution of

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.370
all these parameter values.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.720
As you see, here is there's a

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.650
distribution over Theta values that you

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.910
can see here P of theta given X.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.150
So the problem of Bayesian inference is

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:18.190
to infer this posterior distribution

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.070
and also to infer other interesting

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.565
quantities that might depend on Theta.

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:28.250
So I showed F of Theta here as an

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.215
interesting variable that we want to

00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:30.700
compute.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.550
But in order to compute this value, we

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.695
need to know the value of Theta.

00:10:34.695 --> 00:10:36.925
In Bayesian inference, we treat data

00:10:36.925 --> 00:10:39.290
as uncertain variable.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.490
So we think about all the possible

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.490
values of Theta.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.820
Therefore we can estimate the value of

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.396
this function F as the expected value

00:10:48.396 --> 00:10:51.750
of F according to the posterior

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.020
distribution of data

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.130
given the observed evidence X.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.490
As a special case, we can assume F

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.510
of Theta is just equal to Theta.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.623
In this case we get the expected value

00:11:06.623 --> 00:11:08.010
of Theta.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.890
That's basically the posterior mean

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.350
that gives us also one point of Theta. 

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.890
And

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.900
it's sometimes the same as posterior

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.070
mode, but it's not always the same, so

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.520
it gives us another way to estimate the

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.170
parameters.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.270
So this is a general illustration of

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.910
Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.500
inference.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.310
And later you will see this can be

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.730
useful for topic mining where we want

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.150
to inject some prior knowledge about

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.740
the topics.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.780
So to summarize, we introduced the

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.800
language model

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.980
which is basically probability

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.125
distribution over text.

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:48.040
It's also called a generative model for

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.930
text data.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.260
The simplest language model is unigram

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:51.776
language model.

00:11:51.776 --> 00:11:53.520
It's basically a word distribution.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.290
We introduced the concept of likelihood

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.340
function which is the probability of

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.030
data given some model.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.960
And this function is very important.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.510
Given a particular set of parameter

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.400
values, this function can tell us which

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.460
X, which data point has a higher

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.230
likelihood, higher probability.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.260
Given a data point, sorry, given a data

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.720
sample X, we can use this function to

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.670
determine which parameter values would

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.030
maximize the probability of the

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.750
observed data, and this is the maximum

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.800
likelihood estimate.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.420
We also talked about the Bayesian

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.785
estimation or influence.

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:36.600
In this case we must define a prior on

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.370
the parameters P of Theta, and then

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.590
we're interested in computing the

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.610
posterior distribution of the

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.100
parameters which is

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.310
proportional to the prior and the

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.020
likelihood.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.510
And this kind of

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.920
distribution would allow us, then, to

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.440
infer any derived values from Theta.
