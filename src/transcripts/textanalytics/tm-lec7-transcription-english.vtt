00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.950
This lecture is about the Word

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.520
Association mining and analysis.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.100
In this lecture we're going to talk

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.690
about how to mine associations of words

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.530
from text.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.320
This is an example of knowledge about

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.860
natural language that we can mine

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.000
from text data.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.620
Here's the outline.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.460
We are gooing to first talk about what is

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.080
word Association and then

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.550
explain why discovering such

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.080
relations is useful and finally we are

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.600
going to talk about some general

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.660
ideas about how to mine word

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.630
associations. In general

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.260
there are two word relations, and

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.440
these are quite basic.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.440
One is called a paradigmatic

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.970
relation, the other is syntagmatic

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.190
relations.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.630
A&amp;B have paradigmatic relation if they

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.690
can be substituted for each other.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.450
That means,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.290
the two words that have paradigmatic

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.135
relation would be in the same semantic

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:23.510
class or syntactic class, and we can in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.240
general replace one by the other

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.180
without affecting the understanding of

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.880
the sentence.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.390
That means we would still have a valid

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.750
sentence. For example, cat and dog.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.450
And these two words have

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.160
paradigmatic relation because

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.980
they are in the same class

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.490
of animal.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.330
And in general, if we replace cat with

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.470
dog in a sentence, the sentence would

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.140
still be a valid sentence that you can

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.000
make sense of.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.770
Similarly, Monday and Tuesday have

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.130
paradigmatic relation.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.080
The second kind of relation is called

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.680
syntagmatic relation.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.768
In this case, the two words that have

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:16.701
this relation can be combined with each

00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:17.119
other.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.930
So A&amp;B have syntagmatic relation

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.753
If they can be combined with each other

00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:22.820
in a sentence.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.410
That means these two words are

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.710
semantically related.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.010
So for example, Cat and sit are related

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.960
because a cat can sit somewhere.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.400
Similarly, car and drive are related

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.750
semantically, and they can be combined

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.250
with each other to convey meaning.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.050
However, in general we cannot replace

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.320
cat with sit in a sentence or car with

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.920
drive in a sentence to still get a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.986
valid sentence.

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:01.270
Meaning that if we do that, the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.210
sentence will become somewhat

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.240
meaningless.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.960
So this is different from paradigmatic

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.170
relation and these two relations are

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.132
in fact so fundamental, that they

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:20.150
can be generalized to capture basic

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.970
relations between units in arbitrary

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:23.665
sequences.

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:26.680
And definitely they can be generalized to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.380
describe relations of any items in the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.930
language.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.670
So A&amp;B don't have to be words and they

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.710
can be phrases example.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.380
And they can even be more complex

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.110
phrases

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.790
than just a noun phrase.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.767
If you think about the general problem

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:49.250
of the sequence mining, then we can

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.079
think about the units in the sequence

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.310
data, and then we think of paradigmatic

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.353
relation as relations that are applied to

00:04:00.353 --> 00:04:03.160
units that tend to occur in similar

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.370
locations in a sentence or in

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.220
a sequence of data elements in

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.810
general.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.550
So they occur in similar locations

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.830
relative to the neighbors

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.300
in the sequence.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.410
Syntagmatic relation on the other

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.300
hand, is related to co-occurring

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.100
elements that tend to show up in the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.290
same sequence.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.660
So these two are complementary

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.820
and basically relations of words, and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.760
we're interested in discovering them

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.490
automatically from text data.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.420
Discovering such world relations has

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.410
many applications.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.800
First, such relations can be directly

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.990
useful for improving accuracy of

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.523
many NLP tasks, and this is

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:57.680
because this is part of our knowledge

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.650
about the language.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.180
So if you know these two words or

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.516
synonyms, for example, and then you can

00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:05.100
help a lot of tasks.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.850
And grammar learning can be also done by

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.370
using such techniques because

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.806
If we can learn paradigmatic relations,

00:05:14.806 --> 00:05:17.650
then we form classes of words.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.680
Syntactic classes for example.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.770
And if we learn syntagmatic

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.660
relations, then we would be able to

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.250
know the rules for putting together a

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.790
larger expression based on component

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.640
expressions.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.390
So we'll learn the structure and what

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.500
can go with what else.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.785
Word relations can be also very useful

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:45.290
for many applications in text retrieval

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.070
and mining.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.250
For example, in search in text

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.420
retrieval we can use word associations

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.300
to modify a query.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.410
And this can be used to introduce

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.940
additional related words to a query to

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.620
make the query more effective.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.480
It's often called query expansion.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.160
Or you can use related words to

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.610
suggest related queries to the user

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.760
to explore the information space.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.550
Another application is to use word

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.675
associations to automatically construct

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:19.990
the topic map for browsing where we

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.770
can have words as nodes

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.940
and associations as edge. The user

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.240
could navigate from one word to

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.385
another to find information in the

00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:31.200
information space.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.590
Finally, such word associations can also

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.010
be used to compare and summarize

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.740
opinions.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.000
For example, we might be interested in

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.310
understanding positive and negative

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.990
opinions about iPhone 6.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.130
In order to do that, we can look at

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.230
what words are most strongly associated

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.340
with a feature word

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.270
like the battery in positive

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.570
versus negative reviews.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.490
Such a syntagmatic relations would help

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.040
us show the detailed opinions about the

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.570
product.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.320
So how can we discover such

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.200
associations automatically?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.390
Now,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.150
here are some intuitions about how to

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.790
do that.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.990
Let's first look at the paradigmatic

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.580
relation.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.210
Here we essentially can take advantage

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.310
of similar context.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.090
So here you see some simple sentences

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.640
about cat and dog.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.340
You can see they generally occur in

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.490
similar context.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.650
And that, after all, is the definition

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.470
of paradigmatic relation.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.870
So on the right side you can see I

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.000
extracted explicitly the context of cat

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.870
and dog from this small sample of text

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.250
data.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.975
So I have taken away cat and dog from

00:08:02.975 --> 00:08:05.570
the corresponding sentences so that you

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.490
can see just the context.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.760
Now of course we can have different

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.990
perspectives to look at the context.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.870
For example, we can look at the what

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:21.940
words occur in the left part of this

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.520
context.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.260
So we can call this left context. What

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.150
words occur before we see cat, cat or

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:32.670
dog.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.410
So you can see in this case clearly dog

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.540
and cat have similar left context.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.767
You generally say his cat or my cat, and

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:46.980
you say also my dog and his dog. So

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.870
that makes them similar in the left

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.390
context.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.930
Similarly, if you look at the words

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.250
that occur after cat and dog, which we

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.610
can call right context and they also

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.509
very similar in this case, of course

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.860
it's extreme case where you only see

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.650
eats and

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.366
In general you will see many other

00:09:11.366 --> 00:09:11.823
words.

00:09:11.823 --> 00:09:15.360
Of course that can follow cat and dog.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.320
You can also even look at the general

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.020
context.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.785
And that might improve the all words in

00:09:23.785 --> 00:09:26.070
the sentence or in sentences around

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.910
this word.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.320
And even in the general context you also

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.750
see some similarity between the two

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.320
words.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.230
So this is just suggesting that we can

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:43.280
discover paradigmatic relation by

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.119
looking at the similarity of context of

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.810
words.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.860
So for example, if we think about the

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.626
following questions, how similar are

00:09:51.626 --> 00:09:55.040
context of cat and context of dog?

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.369
In contrast, how similar are context of

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.670
cat and context of computer?

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.090
Now intuitively, with imagine the

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.880
context of Cat and context of dog would

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.520
be more similar than the

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.550
context of cat and context of

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.560
computer, that means the first in the

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.140
first case, the similarity value would

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:20.820
be high.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.900
Between the context of cat and dog,

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.830
whereas in the second the similarity

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.450
between contexts of cat and computer

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.730
would be low because they are

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.400
not having paradigmatic

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.450
relationship.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.540
And then imagine what words occur after

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.000
computer.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.270
In general they will be very different

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.080
from what words occur after cat.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.160
So this is the basic idea of

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.870
discovering paradigmatic relation.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.330
What about the syntagmatic relation?

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.520
Here we we are going to explore the

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.610
correlated occurrences again based on

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.610
the definition of syntagmatic relation.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.960
Here you see the same sample of text.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.400
But here we are interested in knowing

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.630
what other words are correlated with

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.990
the verb eats.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.790
And what words can go with eat?

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.170
And if you look at the right side of

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.840
the slide and you will see I've taken away

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.830
the two words around eats.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.020
I've taken away the word to its left and

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.140
also the world to its right,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.970
In each sentence.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.480
And then we can ask the question what

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.190
words tend to occur to the left of eat

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.630
and what words tend to occur to the

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.950
right of eat?

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.760
Now thinking about this question would

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.540
help us discover Syntagmatic relations.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.380
Because syntagmatic relation

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.180
essentially captures such correlations.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.870
So the important question to ask

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.190
for syntagmatic relation is whenever

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.340
eats occurs,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.660
what other words also tend to occur?

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.960
So the question here has to do with

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.850
whether there are some other words that

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.640
tend to co-occur together with eats,

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.564
meaning that whenever you see eat, you

00:12:26.564 --> 00:12:28.209
tend to see the other words.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.340
And if you don't see eat, probably you

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.760
don't see other words often either.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.830
So this intuition can help us discover

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.240
syntagmatic relations.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.290
Now again, consider example-

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.400
How helpful is the occurrence of eats

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.500
for predicting occurrence of meat?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.045
knowing whether eats occurs in a

00:12:53.045 --> 00:12:55.720
sentence would generally help us predict

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.370
the

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.440
Whether meat also occurs indeed as if

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.450
we will see eats occur in a sentence,

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.115
and that should increase the chance

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:05.879
that meat will also occur.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.170
In contrast, if you look at the

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.996
question in the bottom, how helpful is

00:13:12.996 --> 00:13:14.730
occurrence of eats for predicting the

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.740
occurrence of text?

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.480
Because eats and text are not really

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.620
related, so knowing whether eats occurred

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.520
in a sentence doesn't really help us

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.010
predict

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.840
whether text also occurs in the

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.410
sentence.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.660
So this is in contrast to the question

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.150
about eats and meat.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.690
This also helps explain the intuition

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.650
behind the methods for discovering

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.180
syntagmatic relation.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.720
Mainly we need to capture the

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.380
correlation between the occurrences of

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.100
two words.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:52.860
So to summarize, the general ideas for

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.450
discovering word associations are the

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:55.940
following.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.420
For paradigmatically relation we

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.910
represent each word by its context,

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.560
and then compute the context

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.160
similarity.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.320
We are gonna assume the words that have high

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.520
context similarity to have paradigmatic

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.640
relation.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.080
For syntagmatic relation, we will

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.460
count how many times two words occur

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.890
together in a context which can be a

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.000
sentence, paragraph or a document

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:25.330
even.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.810
And we're going to compare their Co

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.910
occurrences with their individual

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.690
occurrences.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.060
We're going to assume words with high

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.390
co-occurrences, but relatively low

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.890
individual occurrences to have

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.830
syntagmatic relations because they tend

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.310
to occur together, and they don't

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.810
usually occur alone.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.608
Note that the paradigmatic relation

00:14:49.608 --> 00:14:52.070
and syntagmatic relation, are actually

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.230
closely related.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.040
In that paradigmatically related words

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.597
tend to have syntagmatic relation with

00:15:01.597 --> 00:15:02.730
the same word that

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.533
they tend to be associated with the

00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:06.763
same word, and that suggests that we

00:15:06.763 --> 00:15:09.500
can also do join the discovery of the

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:10.710
two relations.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.539
So these general ideas can be

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.065
implemented in many different ways, and

00:15:15.065 --> 00:15:18.210
the course won't cover all of them, but

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.710
we will cover at least some of the

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.790
methods that effective for discovering

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.910
these relations.
