00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.750
This lecture is about opinion mining

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.300
and sentiment analysis covering its

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.030
motivation.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.450
In this lecture we are going to start

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.830
talking about mining a different kind

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.486
of knowledge, namely knowledge about

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:25.250
the observer or humans that have

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.740
generated text data.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.200
In particular, we're going to talk

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.360
about the opinion mining and sentiment

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.140
analysis.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.030
As we discussed earlier, text data can

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.580
be regarded as the data generated from

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.730
humans as subjective sensors.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380
In contrast, we have other devices such

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.580
as video recorder that can report

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.420
what's happening in the real world

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.340
objectively to generate the video data,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.230
for example.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.110
Now the main difference between text data

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.250
and other data like video data is that

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.310
it has rich and rich opinions and the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.050
content tends to be subjective because

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.800
it's generated from humans.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.660
Now this is actually unique advantage

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.240
of text data,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.110
as compared with other data

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.640
because it offers us a great

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.550
opportunity to understand the

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.350
observers.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.460
We can mine the text data to understand

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.800
the opinions, understand the people's

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.660
preferences, how people think about

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.220
something.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.030
So this lecture and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.450
the following lectures will be mainly

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.360
about how we can mine and analyze

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.010
opinions buried in a lot of text data.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.056
So let's start with the concept of

00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:55.150
opinion that it's not that easy to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.210
formally define opinion, but mostly we

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.300
would define opinion as a subjective

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.800
statement describing what a person

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.110
believes or thinks about something.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.595
Now I highlighted a quite a few words

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:12.800
here, and that's because it was

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.655
thinking a little more about these

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.350
words and that would help us better

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.459
understand what's in the opinion and this

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.360
further helps us to define opinion more

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.020
formally, which is always needed to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.340
computationally solve the problem of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.300
opinion mining.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.910
So let's first look at the keyword

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.642
subjective here.

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:38.230
Now this is in contrast with objective

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.970
statement or factual statement.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.860
Those statements can be proved right or

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.330
wrong.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.490
And this is a key differentiating

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.590
factor from opinion, which tends to be

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.880
not easy to prove wrong or right

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.360
because it reflects what a person

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.050
thinks about something.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.480
So in contrast, objective statement can

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.720
usually be proved wrong or correct.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.620
For example, you might say this

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.060
computer has a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.970
screen and a battery.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.200
Now that's something you can check.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.320
It's either having a battery or not.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.600
But in contrast, if you think about the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.940
sentence such as this laptop has the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.810
best battery.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.080
Or this laptop has a nice screen, now

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.920
these statements are more subjective

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.130
and it's very hard to prove whether

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.520
it's wrong or correct.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.010
So opinion is subjective statement.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.700
And next, let's look at the keyword

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.820
person here and that indicates this

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.580
opinion Holder 'cause when we talk

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.510
about opinion, it's about the opinion

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.510
held by someone and then we notice that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.730
there is something here.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.675
So that's the target of the opinion.

00:04:06.675 --> 00:04:09.510
The opinions is expressed on this

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.960
something.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.050
And now, of course, believes or thinks

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.490
implies that the opinion would depend on

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.884
the culture or background and context

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.380
in general, because of person might

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.282
think differently in the different

00:04:24.282 --> 00:04:24.660
context.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.990
People from different background may

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.980
also think in different ways.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.920
So this analysis shows that there are

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.560
multiple elements that we need to

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.730
include in order to characterize

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.720
an opinion.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.830
So what's the basic opinion

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.900
representation like, well,Â  it should include

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.280
at least three measurements, right?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.816
First it has to specify what's the

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:49.510
opinion Holder.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.680
So whose opinion is this, second must also

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.920
specify the target.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.930
What's this opinion about?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.489
And 3rd, of course we want opinion

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.003
content and So what exactly is the

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:03.289
opinion?

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.650
If you can identify this, we get a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.630
basic understanding of an opinion and can

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.580
already be useful.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.660
Sometimes if you want to understand

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.490
further, we want to enrich the opinion

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.220
representation.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.596
And that means we also want to

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:18.518
understand, for example, the context of

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.042
the opinion and what situation was

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:22.266
opinion expressed.

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:25.210
For example, in what time was it

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.833
expressed?

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:29.190
We also would like to deeply understand

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.240
opinion sentiment and this is to

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.800
understand,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.430
what the opinion tells us about the

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.340
opinion holder's feeling, for example,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.870
is this opinion positive or negative?

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.760
Or perhaps the opinion holder was

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.350
happy or sad.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.630
And so such understanding obviously

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.760
goes beyond just extracting the opinion

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.350
content and needs some analysis.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.035
So let's take a simple example of a

00:06:03.035 --> 00:06:03.760
product review.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.798
In this case, this actually explicit

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:08.650
opinion Holder and explicit target,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.980
so it's

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.656
It's obviously what's opinion Holder,

00:06:11.656 --> 00:06:13.750
and that's just a reviewer, and it's

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.925
also often very clear what's the

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:18.105
opinion target, and that's the

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:19.230
product being reviewed.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.580
For example iPhone 6.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.340
When the review was posted, usually you

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.850
can extract such information

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.410
easily.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.920
Now the content of course is the review

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.170
text that's in general also easy to

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.630
obtain.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.240
So you can see product reviews are

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.730
fairly easy to analyze in terms of

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.150
obtaining a basic opinion

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.890
representation.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.010
But of course, if you want to get more

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.090
information, we might want to know the

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.710
context.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.020
For example, the review was written in

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.390
2015.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.040
Or we want to know that the sentiment

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.580
of this review is positive, and so this

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.270
additional understanding of course adds

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.580
value to mining the opinions.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.320
Now you can see in this case the task

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.150
is relatively easy, and that's

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.890
because.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.380
The opinion Holder and opinion target

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.940
that have already been identified.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.200
Now let's take a look at the sentence

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.080
in the news.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.500
In this case, we have implicit holder

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.670
and implicit target.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.870
And the task is in general harder so we

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.290
can identify

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.460
opinion holder here and that's

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.870
governor of Connecticut.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.000
We can also identify the target.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.320
So one target is Hurricane Sandy.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.330
But there is also another target,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.010
which is a hurricane of

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.020
1938.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.840
So what's the opinion?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.430
Well, this negative sentiment here

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.450
that's indicated by words like a bad

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.180
and worst.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.190
And we can also then

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.760
identify the context.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.430
New England in this case.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.720
Now unlike in the product review, all these

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.860
elements must be extracted by using

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.460
natural language processing techniques.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.460
So the task is much harder and we need

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.100
a deeper natural language processing.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.880
And these examples also,

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.220
suggest that a lot of work can be

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.300
easily done for product reviews, and

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.470
that's indeed what has happened.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.040
Analyzing sentiment in news is still

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.010
quite difficult.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.160
It's more difficult than the analysis

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.220
of opinions in product reviews.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.080
Now there are also some other

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.300
interesting variations.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.410
In fact, here we're going to

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.850
examine the variations of opinions more

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:43.980
systematically.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.840
First, lets think about the opinion

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.320
Holder.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.542
Now the Holder could be an individual

00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:50.900
or could be a group of people and

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.070
sometimes opinion was from a committee

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.170
or from a whole country of people.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.090
Opinion Target can also vary a lot.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.600
It can be about 1 entity, a particular

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.425
person, a particular product, a

00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:05.120
particular policy, etc.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.320
But it could be about a group of

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:07.940
products.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.560
Could be about the product from a

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.820
company in general.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.830
Could also be very specific about one

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.590
attribute,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.770
attribute of Entity for example.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.810
It's just about the battery of iPhone.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.190
It could be about someone else opinion

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.290
and one person might

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.350
comment on another persons opinion

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.930
etc.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.040
So you can see there is a lot of

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.850
variation here that will cause the

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.360
problem to vary a lot.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.580
Now opinion content, of course, can

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.430
also vary a lot on the surface.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.600
You can identify one sentence opinion

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.589
or one phrase opinion, but you can also

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.610
have longer text to express the

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.800
opinion like a whole article.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.970
And Furthermore, we can identify the

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.040
variation in the sentiment or emotion

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.130
dimension.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.710
That's about the feeling of the opinion

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.290
Holder.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.650
So we can distinguish positive versus

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.480
negative or neutral or happy versus

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.530
sad, etc.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.989
Finally, the opinion context can also

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.460
vary.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.720
We can have simple context, like

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.770
different time or different locations,

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.530
but there could be also complex text

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.030
such as some background topic being

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.750
discussed.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.829
So when opinion expressed in the

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.773
particular discourse context, it has to

00:10:21.773 --> 00:10:23.645
be interpreted in different ways than

00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:25.565
when it's expressed in another context,

00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:28.280
so the context can be very rich to

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.135
improve the entire discourse

00:10:30.135 --> 00:10:32.870
context of opinion. From computational

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.240
perspective, we're most interested in

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.320
what opinions

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.370
can be extracted from text data, so it

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.510
turns out that we can also

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.030
differentiate distinguish different

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.930
kinds of opinions in text data from

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.550
computation perspective.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.570
First, the Observer might make a

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.510
comment about the opinion target in the

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.285
observed world.

00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:53.360
So in this case we have the author's

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.160
opinion.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.310
For example, I don't like this phone at

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.530
all, and that's opinion of this author.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.890
In contrast, the text might also

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.446
report opinions about others so the

00:11:08.446 --> 00:11:11.016
person could also make observation

00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:14.430
about another person's opinion and report

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.080
this opinion.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.610
So for example, I believe he loves the

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.225
painting and that opinion is really

00:11:22.225 --> 00:11:25.690
about, is really expressed by

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.530
another person.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.720
Here, so it doesn't mean this author

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.340
loves that painting.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.410
So clearly the two kinds of opinions

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.880
need to be analyzed in different ways

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.520
and sometimes in product reviews you

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.140
can see, although mostly the opinions

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.955
are from this reviewer.

00:11:44.955 --> 00:11:46.743
Sometimes a reviewer might mention

00:11:46.743 --> 00:11:49.410
opinions of his friend or her friend,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:49.860
right?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.750
And another complication is that there

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.040
may be indirect opinions or inferred

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.750
opinions that can be obtained by making

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.710
inferences on what's expressed in the

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.110
text that might not necessarily look

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.750
like opinion.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.490
For example, one statement might be

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.830
this phone ran out of battery in just

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:12.460
one hour.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.110
Now this is in a way, a factual

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.430
statement, 'cause you know it's either

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.810
true or false, right?

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.640
You can even verify that.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.580
But from this statement one can also

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.729
infer some negative opinions about the

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.070
quality of the battery of this phone or

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.845
the feeling of the opinion holder about

00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:36.490
the battery.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.340
In the opinion, Holder clearly wish the

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.660
battery to last longer.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.330
So these are interesting variations

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.860
that we need to pay attention to when

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.670
we extract opinions.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.070
Also, for this reason about the

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.230
indirect opinions.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.260
It's often also very useful to extract

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.055
it or whatever the person had said

00:12:58.055 --> 00:12:59.860
about the product, and sometimes

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.067
factual sentences like this

00:13:02.067 --> 00:13:03.380
are also very useful.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.900
So from practical viewpoint, sometimes

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.900
we don't necessarily extract the

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.990
subjective sentences.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.826
Instead, would you just get all the

00:13:11.826 --> 00:13:13.840
sentences that are about opinions that

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.082
are useful for understanding the person

00:13:16.082 --> 00:13:17.950
or understanding the product that we are

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.530
commenting on.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.770
So the task of opinion mining can be

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.680
defined as taking text data as input to

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.100
generate a set of opinion

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.030
representations.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.875
In each representation we should identify

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:33.870
opinion Holder, target content and

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:34.500
context.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.420
Ideally we can also infer opinion

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.995
sentiment from the content and context

00:13:39.995 --> 00:13:41.540
to better understand

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.820
the opinion.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.810
Now often some elements of the

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.180
representation are already known.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.890
I just gave a good example,

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.015
in the case of product reviews where

00:13:52.015 --> 00:13:54.320
the opinion Holder and opinion target

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.850
are often explicitly identified, and

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.360
that's not why this turns out to be one of the

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.935
simplest opinion mining

00:14:03.935 --> 00:14:04.762
tasks.

00:14:04.762 --> 00:14:06.950
Now it's interesting to think about

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.840
other tasks that might be also simple,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.440
because those are the cases where you

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.260
can easily build applications by using

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.690
opinion mining techniques.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.510
So now that we have talked about what

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.690
is opinion mining and we have defined

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.180
the task, let's also just talk a little

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.140
bit about the why opinion mining is

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.920
very important and why it's very

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.570
useful.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.295
So here I identify three major reasons,

00:14:34.295 --> 00:14:35.575
3 broad reasons.

00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:37.880
The first is it can help decision

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.480
support.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.650
I can help us optimize our decisions.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.150
We often look at the other peoples

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.020
opinions and look at the reader reviews

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.727
in order to make a decision like

00:14:48.727 --> 00:14:50.620
buying, buying a product, or using the

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.190
service.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.180
We also

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.390
Would be interested in others opinions.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.890
When we decide whom to vote, for

00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.470
example.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.720
And policymakers may also want to know

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.210
peoples opinions when designing a new

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:06.730
policy.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.090
So that's one general kind of

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.740
applications.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.170
And it's very broad, of course.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.990
The second application is to understand

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.370
people, and this is also very

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:17.050
important.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.970
For example, it can help understand

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.410
peoples preferences.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.970
So and this could help us better serve

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.457
people.

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:26.570
For example, we can optimize the

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.030
product search engine, optimize

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.825
recommender system if we know what

00:15:30.825 --> 00:15:33.020
people are interested in, what people

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.590
think about products.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.806
It can also help her with advertising,

00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:39.970
of course, and we can have targeted

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.650
advertising if we know what kind of

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:46.676
people tend to know to like what kind

00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:47.560
of product.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.070
Now the third kind of applications can

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.720
be called voluntary survey.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.360
Now this is mostly to support

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.400
research that used to be done by doing

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.890
surveys, doing manual surveys, questioning

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:01.430
answering.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.070
People need to fill in forms to

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.990
answer some questions.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.490
Now this is directly related to humans as

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.630
sensors, and we can usually aggregate

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.290
opinions from a lot of humans to kind

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.960
of assess the general opinion.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.600
Now this is would be very useful for

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.160
business intelligence, where product

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.430
manufacturers want to know,

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.060
where their products have advantages

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.010
over others.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.450
What are the winning features of their

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.570
product or winning features of

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:35.980
competitive products?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.740
Market research has to do with

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.603
understanding consumers opinions and

00:16:40.603 --> 00:16:43.140
this is clearly very useful, directed

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:43.700
for that.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.080
Data Driven social science

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.410
research can benefit from this because

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.850
they can do text mining to understand

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.855
the people's opinions.

00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:53.889
And if we can aggregate a lot of

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:56.100
opinions from social media from a lot

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.050
of public information, then you can

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.440
actually do some study of some

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.160
questions.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.410
For example, we can study the behavior

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.280
of people

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.030
on social media or in social

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.840
networks, and these can be regarded as

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.100
voluntary survey,

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.070
but done by those people.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.670
And in general, we can gain a lot of

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.070
advantage in any prediction task

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:25.140
because we can leverage the text data

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.210
as extra data about any problem and

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.210
so we can use text based prediction

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.390
techniques to help you make prediction

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.560
or improve the accuracy of prediction.
