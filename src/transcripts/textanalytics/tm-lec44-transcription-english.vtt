00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.450
This lecture is about the sentiment

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.280
classification.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.740
If we assume that most of the elements

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.119
in the opinion representation are already

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.140
known, then our only task maybe just

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.085
the sentiment classification as shown

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:23.120
in this case.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.919
So suppose we know who is the opinion

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.330
holder and what's the opinion target and also

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
know the content and context of the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.570
opinion.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.602
Then we mainly need to decide the opinion

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:38.290
sentiment of the review.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.160
So this is a case of just using

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.510
sentiment classification for

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.710
understanding opinion.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.460
Sentiment classification can be

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.470
defined more specifically as

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.035
follows:

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:54.000
The input is opinionated text

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.510
object.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.430
The output is typically, a sentiment

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.990
label or sentiment tag, and that can

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.990
be designed in two ways.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.860
One is polarity analysis where we have

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.855
categories such as positive, negative

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:07.700
or neutral.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.270
The other is emotion analysis.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.120
That can go beyond polarity to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.220
characterize the feeling of the opinion

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.650
holder.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.580
In the case of polarity analysis, we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.560
sometimes also have numerical ratings,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.270
as you often see in some reviews on the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.670
web.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.440
Five might denote the most positive and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.520
one maybe at most negative,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.600
for example. In general you have just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.030
discrete categories to characterize

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.470
the sentiment.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.880
In emotion analysis, of course, there

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.823
are also different ways to design the

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:48.406
categories.

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:51.190
The six most frequently used

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.360
categories are happy, sad, fearful,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.260
angry, surpised and disgusted.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.200
So as you can see, the task is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.350
essentially a classification task or

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.203
categorisation task.

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:06.680
As we've seen before, so it's a special

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.620
case of text categorization.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.050
This also means any text categorization

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.480
method can be used to do sentiment

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.230
classification.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.140
Now, of course, if you just do that,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.405
the accuracy may not be good because

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.660
sentiment classification does require

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.156
some improvement over regular text

00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:28.020
categorization technique or simple text

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.220
categorization technique.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.790
In particular, it needs two kinds of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.750
improvements.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.200
One is to use more sophisticated

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.090
features that may be more appropriate

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.530
for sentiment tagging, as I will

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.230
discuss more in a moment.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.890
The other is to consider the order of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.040
these categories.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.070
An especially polarity analysis, very

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.067
clear that order here and so these

00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:55.160
categories are not all that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.970
independent.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.090
There is order among them, and so it's

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.070
useful to consider the order.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.670
For example, we could use ordinal

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.600
regression to do, and that's something

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.110
that will talk more about later.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.900
So now let's talk about some features

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.560
that often very useful for text

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.160
categorization and text mining in

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
general, but some of them are

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.050
especially also needed for sentiment

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.703
analysis.

00:03:17.703 --> 00:03:21.530
So let's start from the simplest one,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.420
which is character n-grams.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.320
You can just have a sequence of

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.770
characters as a unit,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.160
and they can be mixed with different

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.500
n(s),  different lengths.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.670
And this is a very general way, and a very

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.460
robust way to represent the text data.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.360
You could do that for any language pretty

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.750
much.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.240
And this is also robust to spelling

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.500
errors or recognition errors, right?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.550
So if you misspelled the word by 1

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.140
character and this representation

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.810
actually would allow you to match this

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.510
word when it occurs in the text

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.250
correctly.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.980
So misspelled word and the correct form

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.430
can be matched because they contain

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.900
some common n-grams of characters.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.170
But of course such a representation

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.340
would not be as discriminative as

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.940
words.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.510
So next we have word n-grams, a

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.820
sequence of words and again we can mix

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.110
them with different lengths.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.770
Uni Grams are actually often very

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.460
effective for a lot of text processing

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.350
tasks and that's mostly because words are well

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.890
designed

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.190
features by humans for

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.220
communication, and so they often good

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.280
enough for many tasks, but it's not

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.500
good or not sufficient for sentiment

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.000
analysis

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.500
clearly.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.350
For example, we might see a sentence

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.409
like it's not good or it's not as good

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:46.905
as something else.

00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:49.356
So in such a case, if you just take a

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:51.017
good and that would suggest positive,

00:04:51.017 --> 00:04:52.120
it's not good,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.820
so it's not accurate, but if you

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.670
take the bigram, not good together, and

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.240
then it's more accurate, so longer

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.830
n-grams are generally more

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.420
discriminative and they are more

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.110
specific.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.750
If you match it and it says a lot and

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.580
it's accurate.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.630
It's unlikely, very ambiguous.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.780
But it may cause overfitting because

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.589
with such very unique features the

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.180
machine learning program can easily

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.140
pick up such features from the training

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.632
set and to rely on such unique features

00:05:24.632 --> 00:05:26.390
to distinguish categories.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.860
An obviously that kind of classifier

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.430
won't generalize well to future data when

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.430
such discriminating features will not

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.650
necessarily occur.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.202
So that's a problem of overfitting.

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:38.950
That's not desirable.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.640
We can also consider part of speech

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.220
tag

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.380
n-grams, if we can do part of speech

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.240
tagging and for example, adjective,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.850
noun could form a pair.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.755
We can also mix N grams of words and N

00:05:52.755 --> 00:05:54.810
grams of part of speech tags.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.450
For example, the word great might be

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.740
followed by a noun and this could become

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.830
a feature, a hybrid feature.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.470
That could be useful for sentiment

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.190
analysis.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.400
So next we can also have word classes,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.090
so these classes can be syntactic

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.650
like a part of speech tags.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.120
Or could be semantic and they might

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.370
represent concepts in the thesaurus or

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.970
ontology like word net.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.320
Or they can be recognized the named

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.520
entities like people or place and these

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.215
categories can be used to enrich the

00:06:29.215 --> 00:06:30.665
representation as additional features.

00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:33.080
We can also learn word clusters

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.010
empirically, for example we talked

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.369
about mining associations of words and

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.450
so we can have cluster of

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.389
paradigmatically related words or

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.073
sementically related words.

00:06:45.073 --> 00:06:48.129
And these clusters can be features to

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.685
supplement the word based

00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:50.250
representation.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.667
Furthermore, we can also have frequent

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:54.720
pattern syntax and these could be

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.823
frequent word set.

00:06:55.823 --> 00:06:57.960
The words that formed a pattern do

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.350
not necessarily occur together or next

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.900
to each other.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.463
But we also have locations where the

00:07:04.463 --> 00:07:06.690
words might occur more closely

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:07.310
together.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.900
And such patterns provide a more

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.030
discriminative features than words,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.890
obviously, and they may also generalize

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.820
better than just the regular n-grams

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.090
because they are frequent, so you can

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.470
expect them to occur also in test data

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.525
so they have a lot of advantages, but

00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:28.250
they might still face the problem of

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.680
overfitting as the features become more

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.340
complex.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.630
This is the problem in general, and the

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.500
same is true for parse tree based

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.066
features where you can use a parse tree

00:07:39.066 --> 00:07:41.350
to derive features such as frequent

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.020
subtrees or paths, and those are even

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.053
more discriminating, but they also are

00:07:48.053 --> 00:07:50.290
more likely to cause overfitting.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.670
And in General, Patton discovery

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.850
algorithms are very useful for feature

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.610
construction, because they allow us to

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.270
search in a larger space of possible

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.350
features that are more complex than

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.787
words that are sometimes useful.

00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:06.240
So in general, natural language

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.520
processing is very important to derive

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.406
complex features.

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:13.203
They can enrich text representation.

00:08:13.203 --> 00:08:15.460
So for example, this is a simple

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.400
sentence that I showed you long time

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.370
ago, and in another lecture.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.400
So from these words we can only derive

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.520
simple world n-grams representations or

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.150
character n-grams.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.650
But with NLP we can enrich the

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.274
representation with a lot of other

00:08:33.274 --> 00:08:34.965
information such as part of speech

00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:38.760
tags, parse trees or entities, or even

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.700
speech act.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.040
Now with such enriched information, of

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.150
course, then we can generate a lot of

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.080
other features, more complex features,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.898
like a mixed grams of word and part of

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:51.570
speech tags.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.290
Or even a part of parse tree.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.250
So in general, feature design actually

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.940
affects categorization accuracy

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.350
significantly, and it's a very

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.500
important part of any machine learning

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.650
application. In general,

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.560
I think it would be most effective if

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.180
you can combine machine learning, error

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.215
analysis and domain knowledge in designing

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:14.990
features.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.610
So first you want to use domain

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.080
knowledge and your understanding of the

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.200
problem to design seed features.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.950
And you can also define a basic feature

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.570
space with a lot of possible features

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.990
for the Machine learning program to

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.554
work on.

00:09:29.554 --> 00:09:31.630
And machine learning can be applied to

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.640
select the most effective features or

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.230
construct the new features that feature

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.680
learning.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.050
And these features can then be further

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.100
analyzed by humans through error

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.860
analysis.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.020
And you can look at the categorization

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.530
errors and then further analyze what

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.916
features can help you recover from

00:09:49.916 --> 00:09:52.150
those errors or what features cause

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.830
overfitting and cause those errors, and

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.690
so this can lead to feature validation

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.530
that would revise the feature set and

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.570
then you can iterate and we might

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.630
consider using a different feature

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.230
space.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.820
So NLP enriches text representation.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.190
As I just said and because it enriches

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.995
the feature space.

00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:15.756
It allows much larger search space of

00:10:15.756 --> 00:10:16.048
features.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:18.370
And there are also many meaningful

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.593
features that can be very useful for a

00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:21.420
lot of tasks.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.419
But be careful not to use a lot of

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.020
complicated features because it can

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.885
cause overfitting or otherwise you have

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:33.739
to do the training carefully, not to

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.080
let

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.910
overfitting happen.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.160
So a main challenge in designing features,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.180
a common challenge is to optimize the

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.710
tradeoff between exhaustivity and

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.590
specificity.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.250
And this trade off, it turns out to be

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.260
very difficult.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.030
Now, exhaustivity means we want the

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.555
features to actually have high coverage

00:10:57.555 --> 00:10:59.450
of a lot of documents.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.510
And so in that sense, you wanted

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.640
features to be frequent.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.590
Specificity requires the feature to be

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.450
discriminative, so naturally infrequent

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:11.869
features tend to be more

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.520
discriminating, so this really caused

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.860
tradeoff between frequent versus

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.930
infrequent features, and that's why

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:22.620
feature design is generally an art.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.600
That's perhaps the most important part

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.800
in applying machine learning to any

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.960
problem in particular.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.580
In our case, for text categorization,

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.620
or more specifically, sentiment

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.420
classification.
